If the topic is valid, reply with only a JSON, which must respect the following format:
    - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
    - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
    - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
        - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code. It ends with the character '_' followed by a new generated GUID.
        - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
        - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
    - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
        - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code. It ends with the character '_' followed by a new generated GUID.
        - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
        - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
        - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
        - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
    - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following: 
  - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
  - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
  - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
  - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
