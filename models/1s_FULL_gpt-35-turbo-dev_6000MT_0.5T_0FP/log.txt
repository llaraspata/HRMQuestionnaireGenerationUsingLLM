    - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
    - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
    - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
        - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code. Append a random GUID to this code.
        - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
        - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
