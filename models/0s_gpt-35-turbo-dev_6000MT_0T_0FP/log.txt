        - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
        - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
        - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
        - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
    - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following: 
  - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
