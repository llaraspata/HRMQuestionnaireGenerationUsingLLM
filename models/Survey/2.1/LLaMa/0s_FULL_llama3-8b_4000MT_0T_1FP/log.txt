[LLM ANSWER]
Here is an example questionnnaire for investigating employee experiences during their first few weeks at work, specifically focusing inducting new hires into your organization.

**On-Boarded and Ready to Thrive: Your Feedback Matters!**

We're excited you've joined our team!

To help us improve the onboarding process (and make it even better), we'd love for YOU share some thoughts. Please take a few minutes answer these 6 questions:

1.
What was your most memorable moment during orientation? Was there something that really stood out to me, or perhaps an "aha" lightbulb went off?

(Open-ended text response)

2.

How would you rate the overall quality of our onboarding program (outstanding | good enough| needs improvement)?

(Scale: 1-5; where 'Outstading' is a score and means it exceeded your expectations, while ‘Needs Improvement’ indicates that there was room for growth.)

3.
What do I wish we had covered during the first few days/weeks of onboarding? Was something missing or would you have liked more information about [specific topic]?

(Open-ended text response)

4.

How easy did it feel to get started with our company's systems, tools and software (very | somewhat| not very/not at all)?

(Scale: 1-5; where 'Very' means the process was seamless & intuitive for you.)

**Bonus Question!**

What one thing would make your onboarding experience even better? Would it be more [specific resource/personalized support] or something else entirely?

(Open-ended text response)

6.
How likely are YOU to recommend our company's On-Boarding program (very | somewhat| not very/not at all) based upon YOUR own experiences so far?



(Scale: 1–5; where 'Very' means you'd highly encourage others join the team.)

Thank You for taking a few minutes of your time! Your input will help us refine our onboarding process and make it even more effective.

Here is our first draft:

**Feedback Mechanics Questionnaire**

We want hear from you! Your input will help us improve and refine how we gather feedback within your department. Please take the time to share what's working, not so much (and why), or if there are areas where more support would be helpful.

1.
On a scale of 0-5 ("Not at all" - "Very often"), please rate yourself on giving constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement:

* Not applicable
(Open-ended text field)

2. What do you think is the most effective way to provide feedback within your team/department? (Select one or more)
	+ Verbal conversations with colleagues/supervisors 
    + Written notes/email/docs shared among teams  
     Regular meetings/check-ins for open discussion   
      Other: _______________________

3.
Have there been instances where you felt hesitant, unsure about how to provide feedback in the past?

If yes:
What was holding back your willingness? (Open-ended text field)

4. How do we currently handle and address concerns or issues raised through our existing mechanisms?
Please rate on a scale of 1-5 ("Not at all" - "Very well"):
* Concerns are addressed promptly
(Select one)
    * Most times, but not always 
     Rarely/Sometimes

Let us know if there's anything we can do better! (Open-ended text field)

6. Are you aware that our company has an anonymous feedback system? If yes/no:
What would make this mechanism more effective for your needs?

Please let me convert it into a specific format, such as PDF or Word document.

How may I assist further with the questionnaire content step by-step process?
Would like to add any additional questions based on user input.
