c) Work-life balance and flexibility options

2. How would rate the current alignment between our company's goals with my personal aspirations? (Scale 0-5)

3.
What are your top three skills you'd like to develop further in next [X] years?

4.

Which of these career paths resonates most closely: 
a) Leadership & Management
b) Technical Expertise or Specialization
c) Innovation, Creativity and Entrepreneurship

Please select one that best represents where I see myself heading:

5.
What are the top three factors you consider when evaluating a new role? (Select all applicable)

• Job responsibilities/role clarity 
• Compensation package & benefits
• Work environment/culture fit 

6. How often do we need to reassess and adjust our career goals?

a) Every 1-2 years, as personal priorities change or the company evolves

b) Less frequently; I prefer a more stable path with clear milestones ahead

[LLM ANSWER]
Here is a sample questionnaire for investigating career path clarity within an organization:

**Career Path Clarity Questionnaire**

As we strive to support your professional growth and development, it's essential that you have clear insights into the opportunities available in our company. Your input will help us better understand how well-equipped employees are with information about their potential future roles.

Please answer these questions honestly based on what resonates most for YOU:

1. On a scale of 0-5 (where 3 is neutral), to which extent do you feel confident that your current role aligns closely enough with the career path and goals we've discussed?

(Select one: 
   - Not at all
    Somewhat not sure)
2. Have there been instances where unclear expectations or lack of information about future roles has led to feelings like frustration, uncertainty? If yes:

a) How often do these situations arise?
b) What specific aspects are most concerning for you?

3. When considering your long-term career goals within our company (5-10 years), how important is it that the path ahead includes opportunities with similar responsibilities and challenges as what I currently face?



(Select one: 
   - Very Important
    Somewhat Unimportant)
4. Have we provided adequate training or resources to help you develop skills relevant for future roles? If not, which specific areas would benefit from more support?

5. How often do our company's leaders (e.g., managers) discuss and share information about the organization-wide vision, goals, and priorities with employees?



(Select one: 
   - Frequently
    Occasionally)
6. Are there any instances where you've felt pressured to take on additional responsibilities without clear understanding of how they align or contribute directly towards your long-term career objectives?

7. What specific aspects would make our company's internal job postings more appealing and informative for potential candidates (like yourself)?



(Open-ended text response)

8. Have we effectively communicated the skills, qualifications, and experiences required to excel in future roles within this organization?



If not:

a) Which areas do you think are most critical?
b) How would improving communication impact your career development?

9. Are there any specific job titles or departments that interest me for potential growth opportunities? If yes:



(Open-ended text response)

10. What steps, if taken by our company's leadership and HR teams (e.g., regular check-ins), do you believe could significantly enhance the clarity of future role options?



Thank your employees in advance!

**Career Path Clarity Questionnaire**

As we strive to support your professional growth and development, it's essential that you have clear insights into the opportunities available within our organization. This survey aims at understanding how well-defined are current roles in terms of responsibilities, expectations, and future prospects.

Please answer these questions honestly based on your experiences so far:

(Open-ended text response)

2. Have there been any instances where job responsibilities or expectations changed significantly without adequate communication? If yes, please describe:

(Multiple-choice: Yes/No; Open-text for elaboration if "Yes")

3. How often do you feel that your skills and strengths are utilized effectively in the current role?

(Scale from 1-5 (where 1 is rarely to never))

4. Are there any specific areas or departments within our organization where I would like my career path to take me? If yes, please specify:

(Open-ended text response)

5. What motivates you most about your job: the work itself; opportunities for growth and development; recognition from colleagues/management?

(Multiple-choice with options such as "work", "growth & dev.", or a combination of both + open-text field to elaborate if needed)

Here is a sample questionnaire for investigating an employee's experience during their first few weeks at work, specifically focusing on aspects related to effective and efficient integration into your organization:

**Onboarding Experience Questionnaire**

As we continue striving towards creating the best possible start-up journey for our new team members, I'd love it if you could take 5 minutes out of your busy schedule (pun intended) to share some valuable insights with us. Your input will help shape and refine processes that can make a real difference in how well employees settle into their roles.

**1)** What was the most impressive or memorable part about our onboarding process? Was there anything, no matter big nor small, which stood out as particularly helpful?

(Open-ended text response)

2) On average (or so), what would you say is a reasonable amount of time for an employee to feel comfortable with their new role and responsibilities before they start feeling overwhelmed or uncertain about the next steps? 

(Scale: 1-5; where "3" means roughly in line, but open-ended text response encouraged)

**3)** How important do YOU think it would be (on a scale of) for us to provide more detailed information on company policies and procedures during this initial phase?

(Scale: Not at all Important - Very Importance Rating Scale 1-5; where "4" means somewhat, but open-ended text response encouraged)

**4)** Were there any specific colleagues or mentors who made an effort (or not) in making you feel welcome? If so, what did they do that was particularly helpful?

(Open-ended text response with optional rating scale: 1-5; where "3" means somewhat positive experience

 **5**) What would be the most significant change we could make to improve your onboarding journey (if any)? Would it involve more training sessions? More team-building activities, or something else entirely?)

(Free-text box for suggestions)

**6)** Lastly: On a scale of 1-10 how satisfied are you with our current approach towards new employee integration?

(Scale rating from "Not at all" to very Satisfied - Rating Scale; where the middle point is neutral (5))

Thank your time and input!
