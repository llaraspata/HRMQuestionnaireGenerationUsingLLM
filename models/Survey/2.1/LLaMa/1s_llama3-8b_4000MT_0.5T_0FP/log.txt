For the question "How has stress affected your personal life?", I've used `TYPE_ID` 4, as it's a feedback question.

Note that I've only included the first few questions in the `_TF_QUESTIONS` array, but you can add more questions as needed. Also, the `TYPE_ID` for each question is set to 1, which corresponds to the "ID" type (single answer). If you need to use a different type (e.g. rating, feedback, etc.), you can adjust the `TYPE_ID` accordingly.
