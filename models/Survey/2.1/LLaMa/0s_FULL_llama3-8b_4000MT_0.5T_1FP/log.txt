Please note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` 1 for most of the questions, as they are multiple-choice questions. For questions 3 and 9, I've used `TYPE_ID` 6, as they require the respondent to rate something on a scale. For questions 4, 5, and 10, I've used `TYPE_ID` 4, as they require the respondent to provide a text answer.

**Manager Feedback Questionnaire**

We value hearing from you! Your insights will help us improve management practices and create an even better work environment. Please take just few minutes to share your thoughts.

1.
What do we, as a company/management team*, need most improvement on? Is it communication styles**, providing constructive feedback*** or something else entirely?

(Remember: honesty is the best policy! We're here for you and want this experience beneficial.)

2. 
How would rate our current approach to regular check-ins**** with your direct reports (e.g., 1-5, where '3' means "we do it fairly well")? What specific aspects of these meetings are most valuable or areas we should focus on improving?

(Your input will help us refine this crucial aspect!)

**Manager Feedback Questionnaire**

2. 
What's the single best thing our company does for its managers, in terms supporting their growth and development? Is it through training programs***** , mentorship opportunities****** or another initiative entirely?

**Teaming Up: Your Feedback Matters!**

We're eager for you share your thoughts and experiences regarding recent teambuilding activities. Please take this brief survey to help us better understand what works, doesn't work (and why!), so we can tailor future initiatives that meet everyone's needs.

(Please share any specific moments or experiences you enjoyed!)

2. How would rate your overall satisfaction with this year’s summer picnic?

(Scale: 5 - "Absolutely loved it!" to 
"1- Not my cup of tea")

3️⃣ **What did YOU gain from participating in our recent volunteer day event?**

(Please share any insights, new connections made or skills learned!)

4. On a scale (again!), how would you rate the impact on your work relationships after attending that team-building workshop last quarter?

(Scale: 5 - "Tightened bonds!" to 
"1- Didn't notice much change")

🤔 **What do YOU think is missing from our current set of teamebuilding activities?**

(Please share any suggestions, ideas or areas you'd like us explore!)

6️⃣ Finally! What ONE word would best describe your overall experience with team-building initiatives at [Company Name]?
