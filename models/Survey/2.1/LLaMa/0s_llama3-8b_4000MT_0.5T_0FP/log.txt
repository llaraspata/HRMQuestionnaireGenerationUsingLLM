Note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 3 for the questionnaire itself, and the `TYPE_ID` of 1 for most of the questions, which are multiple-choice questions. The questions that require a longer answer (Q2, Q3, Q9, and Q10) have a `TYPE_ID` of 2, which allows for multiple answers. The question that asks for a rating (Q6) has a `TYPE_ID` of 1, but with a different set of answer options. The question that asks for a suggestion (Q10) has a `TYPE_ID` of 4, which is used for open-ended questions.
