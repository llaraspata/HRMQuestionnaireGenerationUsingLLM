Note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 3 for the questionnaire, as per your request. I've also used the `TYPE_ID` of 1 for questions 1, 3, 4, and 6, which are single-answer questions. Questions 2 and 7 are multi-answer questions, so I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 2 for them. Questions 5 is a feedback question, so I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 4 for it.
