Note that I've used the `1` type for most questions, which corresponds to a multiple-choice question with a fixed set of answer options. The `2` type is used for the frequency question, which has a slightly different set of answer options. The `4` type is used for the additional suggestions question, which allows respondents to provide their own text-based answers.
