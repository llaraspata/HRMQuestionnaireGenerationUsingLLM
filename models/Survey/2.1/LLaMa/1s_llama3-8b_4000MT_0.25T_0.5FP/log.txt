[LLM ANSWER]
Here is your **Recognition & Reward Questionnaire!**
Please note that this survey aims at understanding employee perceptions about recognition, rewards, motivation factors within the organization.

1. How often do you feel recognized for your contributions to the company?

   - Daily/Weekly: I receive regular feedback and appreciation
    (e.g., positive comments from colleagues or supervisors)
   
  * Occasionally/Monthly:
     Some managers/supervisors acknowledge my efforts, but it's not consistent

* Rarely/Seldom:
      Recognition is rare; mostly only when something goes wrong
    
2. What motivates you to perform well at work? (Select all that apply)

   - Sense of accomplishment and pride in what I do
    * Opportunities for growth & development within the company
   
  **Recognition from colleagues or supervisors**
   
* Financial rewards/incentives

3. Have your efforts been recognized by management/supervisors recently?

     Yes, specifically mentioned during a performance review/appraisal
    
   No/Not really; it's mostly just my team members who acknowledge me
    * Sometimes I feel like no one notices what we do here...

4. What types of recognition would you find most meaningful? (Select all that apply)

  **Public acknowledgment at company-wide events**
   
* Personalized thank-you notes or emails from supervisors/managers
   
   A dedicated "Employee Spotlight" section on the intranet/newsletter
    * Recognition during a team meeting/departmental gathering

5. How important is it for you to receive rewards/recognition in addition to your regular salary?

     Very Important: It's crucial; I'd feel underappreciated without them
    
   Somewhat Important:
      Rewards are nice, but not essential as long as my work matters
    * Not very/Not at all

6. Have there been any instances where you felt undervalued or unrecognised for your efforts?

     Yes: Describe the situation (optional)

7. Any suggestions on how to improve recognition and rewards within our organization?
