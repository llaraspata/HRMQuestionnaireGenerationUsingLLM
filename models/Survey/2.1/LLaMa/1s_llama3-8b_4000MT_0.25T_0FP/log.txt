Note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 3 for the questionnaire, which corresponds to the "Training and Development Programs" topic. I've also used the `TYPE_ID` of 1 for most of the questions, which corresponds to the "Single answer" type. The questions that require multiple answers (e.g. "What are the most significant factors that affect your work-life balance?") have been assigned a `TYPE_ID` of 6, which corresponds to the "Rating" type. The question that requires open-ended text feedback ("Any additional comments or feedback regarding work-life balance?") has been assigned a `TYPE_ID` of 4, which corresponds to the "Feedback" type.
