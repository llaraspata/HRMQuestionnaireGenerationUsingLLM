4. **What motivates or energizes your work?** Is it helping others, achieving specific goals, learning new things, etc.? Please describe.
5. What are some areas where you'd like to improve and grow in terms of job responsibilities?

Please take the time to answer these five (5) brief questions honestly, as your responses are anonymous unless you choose otherwise at checkout (*).

1.
On a scale of 0-10, where:
	* "2" means never or rarely receive feedback,
	* and
    *   "8/9.99...!" represents always receiving constructive input,

how would rate the frequency with which your supervisor provides performance-related comments?

(Open-ended response)

_____________________________________________________

Please describe any notable instances when you received valuable, actionable advice from a colleague.

________________________________________________________________________

2.
Which of these feedback mechanisms do YOU most frequently use to share concerns or suggestions? (Select one)
a) Verbal conversation
b) Email/Instant Messaging App
c) Online Feedback Form/Survey Tool 
d) In-person Meeting with Supervisor/Mentor 

(Please select only ONE option)

3. How confident are you that your feedback is actually being heard and considered by those who matter most (e.g., supervisors, managers)?

Scale: 1-5

(Where "2" means somewhat uncertain,
   *    "4/9...!" represents fairly certain
     , 
      And "*10*" indicates very sure)

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
Here is a sample Questionnaire for investigating work-life balance within an organization:

**Work-Life Balance Survey**

As part of our ongoing efforts to support employee well-being, we are interested in understanding your experiences and perceptions regarding the integration between personal life (outside working hours) and professional responsibilities. Your input will help us identify areas where improvements can be made.

Please answer these questions honestly based on how you typically feel about work-life balance:

1.
On a scale of 0-5, rate yourself for feeling "in control" when it comes to managing your personal life outside office working hours (e.g., family time, self-care activities). 
(Where: 0 = Not at all in Control; 3.7 or higher means you feel mostly In-Control)

2.
How often do work-related tasks and responsibilities encroach upon non-work related aspects of daily routine? Please rate on a scale from:
Not At All (1) to Almost Always (5)
(Example: You're constantly checking emails, taking calls during family time etc.)

3. 
What are the top three activities you enjoy doing outside office hours that help recharge your batteries and maintain overall well-being?
(Please provide specific examples)

4.
Do work demands or pressures often interfere with personal appointments/commitments (e.g., doctor's visits, school events)? If yes:
How frequently does this happen? 
(1 = Rarely; 2-3 times a month)
What strategies do you use to cope when faced with conflicting priorities?

5. How would rate your overall satisfaction level regarding the balance between work and personal life?
(Scale: Not Satisfied at All (0) - Very Highly Satisified)

6.
Any additional comments or suggestions on how we can better support employees in achieving a healthy Work-Life Balance?
