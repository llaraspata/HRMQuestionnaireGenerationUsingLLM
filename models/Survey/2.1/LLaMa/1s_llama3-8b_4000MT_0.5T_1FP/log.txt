[LLM ANSWER]
Here is your Questionnaire:

Title:**Leadership Perception Survey: Evaluating Leaders' Impact within Our Organization**
 
Introduction:
As part of our ongoing efforts in developing leadership excellence, we are seeking feedback from employees to better understand the impact that leaders have had. Your input will help us refine and improve leader development programs.

**Section 1 - Leadership Style**

Rate your supervisor's/leader’s effectiveness on a scale (0-3):

* **Empowerment**: Does my superviser give me autonomy in making decisions?
	+ Not at all
    + Somewhat 
   * Moderately Well  
     Extremely

How would you rate the leadership style of this leader? 

1: Autocratic - Makes most or almost every decision without input from others.
2. Democratic- Encourages participation and collaboration, but still makes final decisions.

**Section 3 – Communication**

Rate your supervisor's/leader’s communication effectiveness on a scale (0–4):

* **Clear Expectations**: Are expectations for performance clearly defined?
    + Not at all
   * Somewhat 
     Moderately Well  
       Extremely

How would you rate the leader in terms of keeping employees informed about changes or updates?

1: Poor - Infrequent communication, often leaving us feeling uninformed.
2. Fair- Communication is average; we receive some information but not always timely.

**Section 4 – Decision-Making**

Rate your supervisor's/leader’s decision-making effectiveness on a scale (0–3):

* **Inclusive**: Does my leader involve me in the process of making decisions?
    + Not at all
   * Somewhat 
     Moderately Well  
       Extremely

How would you rate this leadership for being open to new ideas and suggestions?

1: Closed- Mind - Resistant or unwillingto consider alternative perspectives.
2. Open-Minded – Willingness is present, but the leader may not always act on it.

**Section 5– Employee Engagement**

Rate your supervisor's/leader’s impact in terms of employee engagement:

* **Motivation**: Does my leadership inspire me to perform at a higher level?
    + Not motivated
   * Somewhat 
     Moderately Well  
       Extremely

How would you rate the leader for fostering an environment that encourages collaboration and teamwork?

1: Poor - Little or no emphasis on team building.
2. Fair- Some effort is made, but it's not always effective.

**Section 6 – Overall Satisfaction**

On a scale (0–5), how satisfied are your with this leadership in terms of overall effectiveness?
