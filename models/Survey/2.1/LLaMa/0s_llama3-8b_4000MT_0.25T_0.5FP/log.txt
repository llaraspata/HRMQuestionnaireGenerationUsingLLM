3. Have you noticed a significant change (positive/negative) among your team members since the last performance review? If so:
    * Please describe this shift.

**Section 3: Communication & Feedback**

1. How would rate my ability as their manager in providing constructive feedback that is specific, timely and actionable?

Please note that I had to adjust the question types and answers to fit the JSON format. Specifically, I used type ID 1 for multiple-choice questions, and type ID 8 for the rating question (q5). I also used the same answer format for all questions, which is an array of objects with a single property 'ANSWER'.

[LLM ANSWER]
Here's a sample questionnaire for investigating workplace environment:

**Workplace Environmental Survey**

We value our employees' opinions and want to create an optimal work atmosphere that supports your well-being, productivity, and job satisfaction. Your feedback will help us identify areas of improvement.

Please answer the following questions honestly based on your experiences in this organization (if you have multiple roles or departments within the company, please respond according to what is most relevant).

**Section 1: Physical Workspace**

1. How would rate overall cleanliness and maintenance of our office spaces?

(Scale: Very Clean - Somewhat Dirty)

2. Are there adequate natural light sources available in your workspace? If not, how do you compensate (e.g., using lamps or adjusting computer settings)?

3. Do the temperature controls meet with most employees' comfort levels during different seasons?
	* Yes
	* Mostly yes/no/unsure

4. How would rate noise level and distractions within our office spaces?

(Scale: Very Quiet - Quite Loud)

5. Are there sufficient break areas or quiet rooms for relaxation, contemplation, or focused work? If not, what features do you think are missing (e.g., comfortable seating)?

**Section 2: Social Environment**

4. How would rate the level of respect among coworkers towards each other's differences (e.g., cultural backgrounds)?

5. Are there any social or professional development opportunities that you wish were available but are not currently offered? If so, what specific initiatives do you think could enhance our workplace environment?

(Scale: Strongly Agree/Neutral/Somewhat Disagree)

2. How would rate your supervisor's approach to feedback, coaching, or addressing concerns?
	* Very Effective - Somewhere In Between
