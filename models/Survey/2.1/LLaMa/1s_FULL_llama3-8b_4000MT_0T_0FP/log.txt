Please note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` 1 for most of the questions, which corresponds to a multiple-choice question. For question Q5, I've used `TYPE_ID` 2, which corresponds to a multiple-select question. For question Q9, I've used `TYPE_ID` 4, which corresponds to an open-ended question.

Note that I've used the type ID 3 for the questionnaire, which corresponds to the "Feedback" type.

The question with type ID 4 is the open-ended question that allows respondents to provide their own feedback.
