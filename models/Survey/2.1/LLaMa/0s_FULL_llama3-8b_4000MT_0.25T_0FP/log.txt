* Take the time to listen to your concerns and ideas (Scale: 1 = Rarely, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often, 4 = Almost Always)
* Provide clear guidance and direction (Scale: 1 = Rarely, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often, 4 = Almost Always)

* Fostering a positive and inclusive work culture (Scale: 1 = Not Effective, 2 = Somewhat Effective, 3 = Very Effective, 4 = Extremely Effective)

**Question 3:** Have you ever received feedback or coaching from your leader that helped you grow professionally? If so, please describe the impact it had on your work and career.

* Providing constructive feedback and recognition (Open-ended text box)
* Adapting to changing circumstances and priorities (Open-ended text box)

**Question 5:** On a scale of 1-5, how confident do you feel in your leaders' ability to:

* Make decisions that align with the company's values and mission (Scale: 1 = Not Confident, 2 = Somewhat Confident, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Confident, 5 = Extremely Confident)
* Develop and implement effective strategies for growth and improvement (Scale: 1 = Not Confident, 2 = Somewhat Confident, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Confident, 5 = Extremely Confident)
