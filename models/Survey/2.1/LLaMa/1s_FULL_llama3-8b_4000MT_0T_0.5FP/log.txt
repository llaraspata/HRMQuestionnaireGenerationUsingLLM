Note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 3 for the questionnaire, which corresponds to the "Feedback Mechanisms" questionnaire. Each question has a `TYPE_ID` of 1, which corresponds to a single-answer question. The answers for each question are represented as an array of objects, each with a single property `ANSWER` containing the answer text.
