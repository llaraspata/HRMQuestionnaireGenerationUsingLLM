Note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 3 for the questionnaire, which corresponds to the "Other" type.

The answers for the questions are represented as strings, and the `_TF_ANSWERS` array is empty for the last question, which is a feedback question.

Note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 3 for the questionnaire, as per your request. I've also used the `TYPE_ID` of 1 for most of the questions, as they are multiple-choice questions. The questions that require open-ended answers (e.g. "What are the most common tasks or responsibilities that contribute to your workload?") have a `TYPE_ID` of 4.

Note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 3 for the questionnaire, as per your request. I've also used the `TYPE_ID` of 1 for most of the questions, which corresponds to a multiple-choice question. The `AREAS_FOR_IMPROVEMENT` and `ADDITIONAL_COMMENTS` questions have a `TYPE_ID` of 4, which corresponds to an open-ended question.
