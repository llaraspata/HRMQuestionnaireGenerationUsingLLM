For question 9, I used `TYPE_ID` 4, which corresponds to the "DESCRIPTION" type (open-ended feedback). For question 10, I used `TYPE_ID` 8, which corresponds to the "DESCRIPTION" type (date or date/time).

Note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 3 for the questionnaire, as per your request. I've also used the `TYPE_ID` of 1 for most of the questions, which corresponds to the "ID" type (single answer). The questions `q6` and `q9` have `TYPE_ID` of 4, which corresponds to the "DESCRIPTION" type (open-ended text). The question `q8` has `TYPE_ID` of 5, which corresponds to the "DESCRIPTION" type (open-ended text) with a reordering option.
