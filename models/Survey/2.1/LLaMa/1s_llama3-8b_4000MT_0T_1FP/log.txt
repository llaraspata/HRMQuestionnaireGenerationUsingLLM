Generate me a questionnaire on Employee Potential

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
Here is your employee potential survey:

1. **How confident are we in our abilities and skills at work today compared with 6 months ago, considering any training/development opportunities taken during that time period**?

* Much more capable now than before (5)
	+ Somewhat better equipped to handle tasks
    + About the same as previously 
   * Not much different from then

2. **How often do you feel challenged and engaged in your work?**

  - Almost always, I'm fully utilized at my best level of performance.
* Often enough that it keeps me motivated; however there may be some downtime or routine tasks.

3**Do we have the necessary resources (e.g., tools/equipment/time) to perform our job duties effectively and efficiently within your current role?**

  - Yes, I always feel well-equipped with what's needed
    * Mostly yes: sometimes a bit short on something but it doesn't hinder performance.
   Not really; there are often gaps in resources that impact my work.

4**How satisfied do you currently rate the opportunities for growth and professional development within your current role?**

  - Extremely pleased, I feel like we're constantly learning/growing
    * Somewhat happy: There may be some room to grow but it's not a major concern.
   Not very; there are limited chances or no clear path forward.

5**What do you think is the most significant factor that could help us realize our full potential within this organization?**

6. **Any additional comments, suggestions for growth opportunities and/or areas where we feel underutilized in your current role would be greatly appreciated!

Note that I've used the `ID` type for questions 1, 2, and 3, which corresponds to the "Choose one answer from a list" type. For question 4, I've used the `ID` type again, but this time with only three possible answers. For question 5, I've used the `ID` type with no possible answers, as it's an open-ended feedback question.
