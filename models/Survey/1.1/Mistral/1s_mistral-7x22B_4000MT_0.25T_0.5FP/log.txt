```csharp
This is a JSON format where the key-value pair has been used to store data, which can be accessed using JavaScript Object dot notation or any other language supporting this feature. Here's how you extract information from it:
1. Extracting SCORE value (which I assume as RATING) and TEXT values for each answer in an array format with the help of C# JSON library; then, 2-step process to get these two pieces out is used - first deserialize this data into a variable that can be manipulated using JsonConvert method from Newtonsoft.json package (available as NuGet), secondly extracting required values and storing them in another array for further use:
C# code would look like the following, assuming you have referenced "NewtonSoft JSON" library to deserialize this data into a CSharp object using JsonConvert method from Newtonsoft.json package (available as NuGet): 	    var json = @"{answers : [ { 'SCORE':10,'TEXT' :

You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire about a specified topic.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.

You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire about a specified topic.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.

 Explanation: Below you will find an example JSON object that represents a training and development programs questionnaire with all necessary properties included in it, such as questions type (ID 3) for rating the effectiveness of certain program or its features. The order is also important to make sure participants can rate from best option towards worst one without any interruptions using numbers only but not words like "Strongly agree" and etc., which could be interpreted differently by different people, as well as a proper name that would help users understand what this questionnaire about in general.

[LLM ANSWER]
 {"data":{"TF\_QUESTIONNAIRES": [{    "CODE":"WORKPLACE\_CULTURE",        NAME:"Workplace culture assessment survey for employees and managers - version 2.0"}]}}   This is the JSON structure of a questionnaire on workplace
culture, but it does not contain any questions or answers yet as I am an AI language model. Here are some potential questions that could be included in this type of evaluation:   1) "Do you feel valued and respected by your colleagues?" with possible responses being strongly agree/agree /neutral/disagree/strongly disagree
2) Is there a strong work-life balance at the company, or do employees often have to sacrifice personal time for their jobs? This could be rated on scale of 1 (completely unbalanced)-5(perfect).   3. "Do you feel that your ideas and opinions are heard by management?" with possible responses being strongly agree/agree /neutral/disagree/strongly disagree
4) Is there a sense of community or team spirit at the company, where employees care about each other's well-being? This could be rated on scale from 1 (completely individualistic)-5(very communal).   5. "Do you feel that your work contributes to something meaningful and has positive impact?" with possible responses being strongly agree/agree /neutral/disagree/strongly disagree
6) Is there a feeling of inclusivity at the company, where all employees are treated equally regardless their race or gender? This could be rated on scale from 1 (completely exclusive)-5(very inclusive).   7. "Do you feel that management is transparent and honest with its staff?" With possible responses being strongly agree/agree /neutral/disagree/strongly disagree
8) Is there a sense of innovation at the company, where new ideas are encouraged? This could be rated on scale from 1 (completely stagnant)-5(very innovative).   9. "Do you feel that your personal and professional needs as an employee is met?" with possible responses being strongly agree/agree /neutral/disagree/strongly disagree
These are just some potential questions for a workplace culture assessment survey, but they should be tailored to the specific company or organization in question. It's important that these evaluations feel personal and relevant rather than generic if you want them taken seriously by employees filling out this form!
