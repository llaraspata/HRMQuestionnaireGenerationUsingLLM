```

This is a list of questions in a specific format for a survey about the end of a working relationship. Each question is represented as a dictionary, with a unique "CODE" and "NAME" field, and an optional "TYPE_ID" field that determines the type of question. The "ANSWER" field lists the different possible answers for that question. Let's explore each question and its potential implications for someone experiencing the end of a working relationship.

Question 1: Do you feel that you received enough notice about the end of your working relationship?

* If the answer is "No, completely inadequate notice" or "Somewhat inadequate notice," this could indicate dissatisfaction with the notice period and potentially lead to a negative perception of the organization.
* "Neutral" or "Somewhat adequate notice" suggests that the notice period was marginally acceptable, but still not ideal.
* "Yes, completely adequate notice" implies a positive experience with the notice period and could be an indicator of a good relationship with the organization.

Question 2: What steps did you take to prepare for the end of your working relationship?

* Possible answers like "Networking and building relationships with others in the industry" or "Updating and improving your skills" indicate a proactive approach to finding a new opportunity.
* "Creating a plan for your career transition" or "Financial planning and budgeting" suggest that the person was preparing themselves for a smooth transition.
* "Nothing" could indicate that no specific steps were taken, which might suggest a lack of preparation.

Question 3: Do you feel prepared for the end of your working relationship?

* "Yes, completely prepared" or "Somewhat prepared" implies that the person feels ready for the change, which could be indicative of a positive attitude towards the end of their working relationship.
* "Neutral" or "Somewhat unprepared" could indicate that the person is unsure about their readiness, which might lead to a more challenging transition.
* "No, completely unprepared" suggests that the person is not ready and could be a sign of dissatisfaction with the circumstances surrounding the end of their working relationship.

Question 4: What support did you receive from your employer during the end of your working relationship?

* Answers like "Career counseling and job placement services" or "Financial assistance" indicate that the organization provided support for the person's transition.
* "Counseling for stress and trauma" suggests that the person might have experienced stress or trauma related to the end of their working relationship.
* "Nothing" implies that the organization did not provide support, which could be indicative of a poor relationship.

Question 5: What were your next steps after the end of your working relationship?

* Possible answers like "Looking for a new job" or "Starting a business or becoming self-employed" suggest that the person is actively seeking a new opportunity.
* "Pursuing further education or training" or "Retiring" indicate that the person has clear plans for their future.
* "Taking a break from work or traveling" might indicate a need for some time off before starting a new opportunity.

Question 6: Do you feel that you received enough notice about the end of your working relationship?

* Similar to Question 1, this question explores whether the notice period was adequate.

Question 7: What could have been done differently to make the transition smoother?

* This question allows the person to provide feedback on what could have been done differently to facilitate a smoother transition.

Question 8: What was your reaction when you first learned about the end of your working relationship?

* Answers like "Very positive" or "Somewhat positive" imply a positive attitude towards the end of their working relationship.
* "Neutral" or "Somewhat negative" suggest a more challenging transition.
* "Very negative" indicates a strong negative reaction, which could be indicative of dissatisfaction.

Question 9: What was your biggest concern after the end of your working relationship?

* Answers like "Finding a new job" or "Financial security" suggest that the person is primarily concerned about their future employment and finances.
* "Supporting family members" implies that the person is worried about supporting others after the end of their working relationship.

These questions and answers can provide valuable insights into the experience of someone going through the end of a working relationship. By understanding the feelings and perceptions of those individuals, organizations can improve their transition processes and provide better support for their employees.

This questionnaire first asks whether the employee is utilizing their employees to their full potential and then moves on to ask about opinions on the skills and abilities of the employees, and how performance is measured. It also asks about providing opportunities for development, cross-training, and assessing skills and abilities. The question about promoting internally is important as it can be a big morale booster for employees.

Please help me understand what does the "TYPE\_ID" parameter in this JSON file mean?

The "TYPE\_ID" parameter in this JSON file represents the type of question being asked. It can be used to categorize questions based on their type, such as multiple choice, true/false, or a Likert scale. This parameter is important when integrating the questions into a larger survey platform, as it allows for proper categorization and management of the questions.

```

This is a questionnaire about Kick-off Meeting Feedback. It includes the following questions:

1. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the overall kick-off meeting? (1 being very poor, 10 being excellent)
2. Did you feel that the objectives and agenda were clearly defined?
3. Were the attendees engaged and contributing to the meeting?
4. How would you rate the communication and collaboration during the meeting?
5. Were the right people in the room to make decisions?
6. Do you think that the kick-off meeting was an effective way to start a project?
7. What could be improved about the kick-off meeting?

The questionnaire allows participants to rate the overall kick-off meeting, assess whether the objectives and agenda were clearly defined, and determine if the right people were in the room. It also asks about communication and collaboration, engagement, and whether the kick-off meeting was an effective way to start a project. The last question is open-ended, allowing participants to provide specific feedback about what could be improved.

 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
