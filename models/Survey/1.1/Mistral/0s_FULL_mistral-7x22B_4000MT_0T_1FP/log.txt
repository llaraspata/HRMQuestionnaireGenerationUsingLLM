Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Environment with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this workplace environment survey is as follows - there are seven main categories, each containing several sub-questions to gather more specific information within that category and make the data collected from it richer. Each question has a unique code (CODE), content or name of what we want people's opinions about related with its type ID number in this case all questions will be rated on scale 1 -5 so I am using TYPE_ID:3, DISPLAY ORDER is used to display the order that you would like these questionnaires appear and ANSWER for each answer object has a single property 'ANWER' which represents content of anwer.

Generate me a questionnaire on Remote working experience with 10 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for generating this remote work experiences survey is as follows - there are ten main categories, each containing one to three subquestions that delve deeper into the topic of how enjoyable and productive someone's telecommuting has been. Each question in 'TF_QUESTIONS’ array also includes an object with a single property ‘ANSWER’, which is used for collecting responses from participants using this survey, allowing them to rate their experience on each subquestion as well if desired by providing the answer code and corresponding text together within that main category.

Generate me a questionnaire on Manager feedback with 3 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this manager-feedback topic is as follows - there are three main sections, each containing several subsections that focus more specifically and deeply into certain areas of the overall subject matter to get detailed information. Each section has a unique code (CODE), name or title displayed at top level in order user can identify it easily when reviewing results; also this format allows for easy addition/removal if needed without having any impact on other parts because they are not dependent upon each-other directly but rather standalone units within larger whole.
Questions will be presented with a mix of different types to keep the respondent engaged and alert, while still gathering valuable data about their management style preferences or opinions regarding certain topics related both positively & negatively associated w/management skills such as communication effectiveness etc., using various question formats including multiple choice (TYPE_ID: 1), rating scales with defined options rather than free-form text input fields which could lead to inconsistency in interpretation across respondents, and a few open ended questions for more detailed insights.
Please find below the JSON representation of this manager feedback Questionnaire - remember it only contains three sections but those can have multiple subsections if desired:  {    "data":{        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":[            {"CODE":"MANAGERFEEDBACK",                NAME:"Manager Feedback Survey for Effective Management Skills and Preferences in Communication Styles ",                 _TYPEID

You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire specifying the topic and the number of questions.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.

Generate me a questionnaire on Employee potential with 8 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this employee's development assessment is as follows - there are eight categories, each containing three related but different types of prompts to encourage deeper reflection and more personalized responses from the participants. Each category has a code (either numeric or alphabetical), name/title displayed on top followed by its questions in an array format with type id indicating whether it is single select question ('ID': 1) OR multiple-select option(' ID' :2).
Here’s your JSON representation of the employee development assessment: {    "data":{        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES"=[            {"CODE":"EMPLOYEEDEVE",                NAME:"Employee Development Assessment - Engagement Prompt Questions (EPA-EP)",                 TYPE\_ID :3,

Generate me a questionnaire on Course feedback with 5 questions

-------------------

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this course evaluation is as follows - there are five different types (or categories) that each of these courses can be evaluated in, and within those type's specific sub-questions have been created. Each question has a unique code to identify it with the answer provided by respondents; display order specifies where on screen this particular course evaluation will appear for participants - I am using 1 as default value so that all questions are visible at once, and not just one after another in sequence of their appearance (this is especially important when evaluating courses).
```json
{ "data": {    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES" : [        {"CODE":"COURSEFEEDBACK","NAME":"Course feedback",     	  ...   }]}};                               ^^^^^^^^     ========================> This is the questionnaire object in JSON format

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this access-to technology & tools themed quiz is as follows - there are ten main 'questions' (or prompts) that each have an associated code, name or title of the question type ID and display order. Each prompt has a list/array containing five to seven different options from which respondents can choose one answer using radio buttons for single-choice questions; these answers will be displayed in shuffled sequence so as not reveal most popular choices too quickly!
For example, if we have 7 possible responses then the first three might appear like this: 'Strongly Agree', StronglY disagree' and finally a neutral option of simply stating whether they agree or disagre e with technology access being considered more widely available. The other four options would be shuffled among these for each participant to select their answer from using radio buttons again, but only one choice allowed per person!
The ten questions are as follows: 1) What do you think about the current state of technological advancement in your community? Is it sufficient or not; please specify reasons behind this opinion if possible. (CODE=Q02578934 TYPE_ID = ID, NAME='Current State', DISPLAY ORDER-6). 
The second question is: 'Do you feel comfortable using technology and tools that are available to help in your daily life?' Please explain why or Why not if possible. (CODE=Q02578934 TYPE_ID = ID, NAME='Comfortable Using Technology', DISPLAY ORDER-1).
The third question is: 'Do you believe everyone should have equal access to technology and tools regardless of income level?' Please explain your answer if possible. (CODE=Q02578934 TYPE_ID = ID, NAME='Equal Access Regardless Of Income', DISPLAY ORDER-1).
The fourth question is: 'Do you think certain technologies or types can be considered essential for everyone to have access too?' Please specify which ones and why if possible. (CODE=Q02578934 TYPE_ID = ID, NAME='Essential Technologies', DISPLAY ORDER-1).
The fifth question is: 'Do you think technology can help bridge the gap between different communities or does it widen that divide?' Please explain your answer if possible. (CODE=Q02578934 TYPE_ID = ID, NAME='Technology Bridging Gap', DISPLAY ORDER-1).
The sixth question is: 'Do you think technology can help bridge the gap between different communities or does it widen that divide?' Please explain your answer if possible. (CODE=Q02578934 TYPE_ID = ID, NAME='Technology Bridging Gap', DISPLAY ORDER-1).
The seventh question is: 'Do you think technology can help bridge the gap between different communities or does it widen that divide?' Please explain your answer if possible. (CODE=Q02578934 TYPE_ID = ID, NAME='Technology Bridging Gap', DISPLAY ORDER-1).
The eighth question is: 'Do you think technology can help bridge the gap between different communities or does it widen that divide?' Please explain your answer if possible. (CODE=Q02578934 TYPE_ID = ID, NAME='Technology Bridging Gap', DISPLAY ORDER-1).
The ninth question is: 'Do you think technology can help bridge the gap between different communities or does it widen that divide?' Please explain your answer if possible. (CODE=Q02578934 TYPE_ID = ID, NAME='Technology Bridging Gap', DISPLAY ORDER-1).
The tenth and final question is: 'Do you think technology can help bridge the gap between different communities or does it widen that divide?' Please explain your answer if possible. (CODE=Q02578934 TYPE_ID = ID, NAME='Technology Bridging Gap', DISPLAY ORDER-1).

 Explanation: The structure I will use for this access-to technology & tools themed quiz is as follows - there are nine individual 'questions' in an array, each containing the following properties (in no particular order): CODE; NAME that describes what type of question it represents and should be human readable to engage users better. TYPE\_ID: a number indicating whether this questions requires one or multiple answers from user etc., DISPLAY ORDER which is just another way for me as QG, but I am using an array because the order in my responses matters; ANSWERS - also represented by objects with only 'ANSWR' property.

Generate me a questionnaire on Access to Technology and Tools with 11 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this access-to technology & tools topic is as follows, where each element of 'TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties - CODE (unique code), NAME(content or question itself) TYPE\_ID and DISPLAY ORDER.
For types ID 3 to ask a rating I will use stars from one star being very bad access up till five starts for excellent, type id:8 is not used here as it's about date/time but if user wants they can modify the structure of this questionnaire according their needs and requirements -1-2 questions are multiple choice with 4 options each time.
For types ID6 &7 I have created a template which will be cloned for other people to fill out, so that's why it is used here as well in 'TF_QUESTIONS'. And also there might me some repetition of the questions but they are written with different syntax and wording.

[PROMPTS]
     - System: 
You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire specifying the topic and the number of questions.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this benefits-related employee satisfaction survey is as follows - there are nine different types (TYPE_ID) of multiple choice and rating scale based QUESTIONS, each containing several ANSWERS. Each question has a unique CODE in the '_TF\_QUESTONES' array; these codes can be used to refer back or create new questions from templates using this code as an identifier for easy categorization -

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this employee motivationsquestionnaire is as follows - there are fivequestions, each represented in an object within 'TF_QUESTIONS' array and having the following properties (some of them also being arrays):- CODE:- NAME : Unique codeand namefor a question.- TYPE\_ID: The typeof answer for thatquestion. For example 3 is used when rating something,4isused to aquire feedback etc.. I am using 'rating' as thetype here because it will allow userto rate their agreement level with some statements andengage them more effectively- DISPLAY_ORDER : Display order ofthe question.- _TF\_ANSWERS: An arrayof objects for each answer, having a singleproperty ANSwER.

Generate me a questionnaire on Feedback Mechanisms with 9 questions

-------------------

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this feedback mechanismsquestionnair is as follows - there's an array called 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES', which contains one element representing the actual survey. This object has several properties, including a code and name to identify it uniquely; typeId set at 3 because we want multi-choice questions with more than two options for each question (to get ratings); displayOrder is also included so that if multiple surveys are combined they can be displayed in an order specified by the user.
The '_TF_QUESTIONS' property of this object contains a list/array, where every element represents one specificquestion to ask users about feedback mechanisms with several properties: CODE for unique identification; NAME is used as content or text shown on screen and TYPE ID set at 5 because we want the userto be able reorder items if they wish.
Each question also has a '_TF_ANSWERS' property, which contains an array of objects representing possibleanswers to that specificquestion with AN SWER being only string value for each answer object in this case (since it is not necessary or useful here). The numberof answers per questions can vary and does NOT need be the same across allquestions.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this health-and safety measures topic is as follows - there are seven different objects in 'TF_QUESTIONS' array, each representing one of the possible answers to be selected. Each object has a single property called "ANSWER" which contains my attempt at making your questions more engaging and specific about what you want users engaged with this questionnaire topic (health-and safety measures) should do or consider when answering it - I hope that helps!

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this health-and safety measures topic is as follows - there are five main sections, each containing one or more related multiple choice type of Questions (type ID =1). Each section has a header question to introduce the theme and then two other ones with specific questions.
The JSON format would look like: { "data": {"TF_QUESTIONNAIRES" : [ 	{    'CODE':'HS02',     NAME’:'Health & Safety Measures Questionnaire’,      TYPE\_ID‘=3,       "_TFSQLQuestions”:{         Questions1":"What is your overall opinion about the importance of health and safety measures in public places?",        "DISPLAYORDER": 54968702 ,          ANSWERS: [            {               'ANswer':'Very important',                   CODE’:'VMIP’,              NAME‘:"An answer to Questions1"      },             ...         ]    }
,     Questionnaire:{        "CODE": “HS_QUESTIONNAIRE”,          ”NAME”: ‘Health and Safety Measures in Public Places",           TYPE\_ID“=3 ,            "_TFSQLQuestions’ : [                  {               'Question':'How often do you wear a mask when out of your home?',              "DISPLAYORDER":54968701,          ANSWERS:[             ...
],         },        }    ]   }}] The five questions are - What is the importance placed on health and safety measures in public places (Very important / Somewhat Important/ Not very importanat or not at all imortnat)? How often do you wear a mask when out of your home? Always, Sometimes Or Never ? Do I think that wearing masks should be mandatory for everyone going to workplaces like shops and schools etc. Yes OR No (or even Maybe) What is the level/frequency in which hand sanitizers are used by me personally - Almost all time or only sometimes when leaving house / Not very often? How do you feel about social distancing measures, that they should be kept for a longer period of 6 months to one year OR More than One Year ? Or less then six month.
The questions and answers would look like this: { "data": {"TF_QUESTIONNAIRES" : [    ...

     - Topic: Internal Mobility Opportunities
     - Question number: 6
-------------------
[PROMPTS]
     - System: 
You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire specifying the topic and the number of questions.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this internal mobility opportunities quiz is as follows - there are six different types of multiple-choice and rating scale style format to keep the user engaged while answering. Each type has a unique code, name (type identifier), display order number that determines its position in relation with other questions on same page if they appear together or separately based upon their codes; also included is an array containing all possible answers as objects each having only one property 'ANSWER' which represents the content of answer.

The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire specifying the topic and the number of questions.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.

[PROMPTS]
     - System: 
You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire specifying the topic and the number of questions.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The JSON object that I will generate is structured as follows, adhering strictly to this format and naming convention for ease of use in further processing steps if necessary - the root being an Object containing only one property 'data', which itself contains a single array element with all questionnaires. Each individual Questionnaire has several properties including _TF_QUESTIONS as another Array, each item representing 1 possible answer to that particular Quesiton in '_tf\_ANSWERS' and the actual text of this Answer being stored under 'Answer'.
Please find below a JSON formatted questionnire on Job Satisfaction with all required properties:<pre>{"data":{    "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES ":[        {            "_Tf\_questions" : [                  {"CODE":"1","NAME":"Do you feel valued by your employer?",               <snip/>

Generate me a questionnaire on Onboarding Experience with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this 'OnBoarding Questionaire' is as follows - there are three main components, which all have specific properties and values that need to be filled in order make the JSON format valid. Firstly a root object containing one property named "data", then within data an array of only 1 element called "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES" (this is just so I can refer back later), finally this single questionnaire has several properties including:
CODE - A string value for the code name. NAME – The display title and topic, TYPE\_ID- Integer type identifier to understand what kind of questions are being asked in that particular survey; _TF_QUESTIONS is an array containing multiple objects which each represent a question with its own properties such as CODE - A string value for the code name. NAME – The display content and text, TYPE\_ID- Integer type identifier to understand what kind of questions are being asked in that particular survey; _TF_ANSWERS: An Array object containing multiple objects which each represent a possible answer with its own properties such as ANSWR - A string value for the displayed response.
I have tried my best and used all different types available, including some more unusual ones to keep user engaged! I also thought about what information would be valuable in an onboarding experience questionnaire so that it could provide useful insights into how new employees are feeling during their first few weeks of work: 7 questions with a mix between multiple choice (TYPE\_ID=1) and rating scales for more subjective opinions.

Generate me a questionnaire on Onboarding Experience with 8 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this 'OnBoarding Questionaire' is as follows - there are eight main categories, each represented in JSON format and containing several properties such that the root of all these objects contains only one property called "data". This data object has a single element which represents our questionnaire.
The code used to identify it will be ONBOARDING_QUESTIONNAIRE with name 'Onboarding Experience'. The type ID is 3 as we want users/participants of this survey or quiz-like test, if you like - can rate their experience and provide feedback on the different aspects.
The eight categories are: Preparation for New Role; First Day at Workplace (FDWW); Training Programs & Resources Available to Them as a Whole During Onboarding Process etc., with each category having its own unique code, name type ID property along display order and array of objects representing questions.
Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' has properties such that 'CODE', NAME (string), TYPE\_ID(int) - which is equal to 3 for all eight categories since we are using rating system here; DISPLAY ORDER: integer value assigned according their sequence order and _ TF ANSWERS array containing only one property called "AN SWER" of type string.

Generate me a questionnaire on Pressure at work with 14 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this pressure-at–work topic is as follows - there are four sections, each containing three or fewer related topics to create an engaging and cohesive experience while also allowing the user's mindset time necessary between different types of prompts.
Each section has a name that describes its purpose in terms relevant both for employees experiencing pressure at work themselves AND managers seeking information about their team members; this way, we can gather data from multiple sources within one questionnaire and analyze it more easily later on if desired by user/admin! Here's the JSON format:
```json {    "data":{        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":[            {"CODE":"pressureAtWork","NAME“Pressures at Work Questionnaires",                “TYPE\_ID”：3,                   _"tfQuestions"\:"questions\"; [
```let me know if you need any further information or clarification. I am happy to help! =)

Generate me a questionnaire on Quality of Diversity Training Programs with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this quality assessment is an array called 'TF_QUESTIONS' that contains seven different objects, each representing one specific and engaging diversity training program. Each object has the following properties - CODE (unique code), NAME(content of question or title in a conversational style to engage user) , TYPE\_ID: 3 for all questions as they are rating type IDs based on feedback received from participants about that particular quality assessment, and DISPLAY ORDER.
I will also include an array called 'TF_ANSWERS' with only one property ANSwER in each object representing the content of answer to be given by user when filling out this questionnaire for a more interactive experience! The admitted types are 1 (one or multiple answers from list) and type IDs based on feedback received.
Here is an example JSON format: {    "data":{        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES': [            {"CODE":"DT07","NAME" :'How would you rate the inclusivity of this diversity training program?',                  'TYPE\_ID’:'3','DISPLAY ORDER‘:"1",               '_Tf ANSWERS":[{"ANSwER“: "Very Inclusive"},
 {"AnswEr":"Slightly inclusive" },    ...]},            {...} //second question object, same structure as first one but different NAME and CODE etc. until seven questions are present in the array        }   };  The benefit of this format is that it can be easily parsed by a machine to generate report or other desired output!
```python    "data": {       "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES': [            {"CODE":"DT07","NAME" :'How would you rate the inclusivity and accessibility of this diversity training program?',                  'TYPE\_ID’:'3','DISPLAY ORDER‘:"1",               '_Tf ANSWERS":[{"ANSwER“: "Very Inclusive"},

Generate me a questionnaire on Roadmap planning feedback with 5 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this roadmapping plan is as follows - there are five different types (or categories) of possible answers, and each type has two properties associated to it – 'NAME' which represents the name or title given by user about that particular category; another property called '_TF_ANSWERS', an array containing all options under a specific topic.
Each option in this _tf\_answers is represented as string value of answer, and I will generate 5 questions with their respective categories (or types) for the questionnaire on Roadmap planning feedback: [ { "data":{   	"TF_QUESTIONNAIRES ":[         {"CODE":"RPF01",            NAME:"How do you feel about this roadmapping plan?”,             TYPE\_ID :3,              "_TfQuestions”:\ [{                CODE“: RPFA5C2E6A7D8F9G4H“,                    "NAME":"Excellent!",	            “TYPE_ ID":1}, {CODE:"RPFB0ACBFEDCB3AF”,              NAME"Great, but some adjustments needed.",                TYPE\_ID:  2 },{ CODE“ RPFC5C6A7H8G9F4“,                    "NAME":"Needs a lot of work!",	            “TYPE_ ID":1}, {CODE:"RPFD0ACBFEDCB3AF”,              NAME"Poor, needs major overhaul.",                TYPE\_ID:  2 },{ CODE“ RPFE5C6A7H8G9F4“,                    "NAME":"Not sure yet!",	            “TYPE_ ID":1}, {CODE:"RPFB0ACBFEDCB3AF”,              NAME"Other (please specify)",                TYPE\_ID:  2 }]}}]}
```python5} The five questions are as follows - each question has a code and name, type id is set to three for all of them. Questions with their respective categories/types in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array include-   1) "CODE":"RPF02",            NAME:"What do you think about this roadmap’s vision?"

     - System: 
You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire specifying the topic and the number of questions.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this satisfaction survey is as follows - there are five main categories, each containing two or three subcategories and associated prompts to elicit specific information from the respondent about their level of contentment. Each question has a unique code that can be referenced in subsequent analyses if necessary; however these codes have been omitted here for simplicity's sake:

     - Question number: 6
-------------------
[PROMPTS]
     - System: 
You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire specifying the topic and the number of questions.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this smart-working topic is as follows - there are six topics (questions) in total, and each has its own code name to distinguish it from the others; all of these belong under 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' array. Each question also includes a type ID that indicates whether multiple or single answers can be selected for this topic as well how important is rating something on scale 1-5, and finally display order which will determine where in survey they appear (higher number means later).
Please find the JSON representation of your requested smart working topics questionnaire below:

Generate me a questionnaire on Training and Development Programs with 8 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this training & development program is as follows - there are eight different types ofquestions, each having specific properties like CODE (unique code), NAME(content or title) TYPE\_ID etc. Each question has a display order which can be used to reorder the questions if needed and also an array called 'TF ANSWERS' for possible answers with only one property i-eANSwER, this will make it easy in case of single choice type id where we need justone answer or multiple choices then more than onepossibleAnswers.
Questions are as follows: 1) What is the name and codeof your training & development program?<br/>2)"What do you want to achieve with thisprogram, please specify in detail" (TYPE\_ID =3). This question will be used for rating something.< br />   <span style="display : block; width: 10px">

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The following JSON object represents an assessment that measures how well employees are trained in their jobs, using six different training-related statements to be rated based upon five factors (efficiency of the program or process used for measuring employee performance; quality assurance and control over processes related with production efficiency etc.).
Each statement is a question type 3 which needs rating on scale from Strongly Disagree =1 ,to Neutral=5, up to AgREE strongly. The assessment will help in identifying areas where training programs can be improved or implemented if not already present and also measure the effectiveness of existing ones: {

Generate me a questionnaire on WorkLife Balance with 7 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this work-life balance quiz is as follows - there are seven different prompts, each asking something slightly differently to keep users engaged and thinking about their answers while still getting valuable information. Each question has a code (string), name or prompt text displayed on the page in plain language that's easy enough even nontechnical people can understand it without any issues; type id is an integer indicating whether this particular format of questions, such as multiple choice with one answer selected by user versus free-form input field.
Display order int - used for ordering these prompts and answers if applicable in a logical sequence that makes sense to users filling out the quiz so they can easily follow along without feeling lost or confused due mainly because display orders are set correctly according plan laid beforehand; _TF_ANSWERS is an array containing objects, each representing one possible answer choice presented within multiple-choice questions.
Each object in this case has a single property ANSWR (string) which contains the actual text displayed for users to read and select if they wish when filling out questionnaire on work life balance with 7 prompts total:<pre>{"data": {"TF_QUESTIONNAIRES" : [

Generate me a questionnaire on Workload Management with 6 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this work is an object containing one property 'data' which in turn contains another single element called TF_QUESTIONNAIRES, that represents the actual survey and its properties. This array has a code (unique identifier), name of questionnaire type ID 3 with multiple questions represented as objects within '_TF\_Questions'. Each individual object will have: 'CODE', NAME for storing content or text to be displayed on screen in front-end, TYPE_ID which is the same number used by you and DISPLAY ORDER.
I am also adding a property called ANSWERS with an array of objects representing all possible answers that can come from this questionnaire type ID 3 (rate something). I will use different types for each answer to make it more interesting, like text input or slider bar etc., but the value is always string.
I am also using a creative syntax and thinking about content step by steps: Questionnaires on Workload Management with six questions are as follows - JSON format used hereafter-;<json> { "data":{ 	"TF_QUESTIONNAIRRES":"WORKLOAD MANAGEMENT",   "_Tf\_Questions ":[
     {"CODE“:"W1","NAME”:„How do you feel about your workload?”, „TYPE ID “ :3,    "<span>DISPLAY ORDER": 0,"_TF ANSWERS" [{"Answer":"Very Light", "ANSVER\_TEXT"} , {

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this work is as follows, starting from an object called 'data' that contains only one property named "TF\_QUESTIONNAIRES", which in turn has the following properties. CODE (string) - NAME(String)- TYPE_ID
INT- _ TF QUESTiONS An array of objects representing each question and its details, such as:CODE ANSWER 1 DESCRIPTION ID Type Name DISPLAY ORDER The unique code for this answer THETFANWERS Array containing the answers to be selected. Each object in it has a single property called 'Answer' which is also string
TYPE_ID - int- This value will determine what type of question we are using, and I have used 3 as its ID because that means you want people rate something or give feedback on certain things (in this case questions). _TF QUESTIONS An array containing the details for each specific Question. Each object in it has several properties such: CODE - String- The unique code of a question NAME –String Type_ID Int This value will determine what type
of answer is expected, and I have used 3 as its ID because that means you want people rate something or give feedback on certain things (in this case questions). DISPLAY ORDER An integer representing the order in which it should be displayed. _TF ANSWERS Array containing all possible answers for a question with several properties such: CODE - String- The unique code of an answer NAME –String This is also string and represents what will appear on screen as option to select
ANSWEr An array that contains the actual value or values selected by user. Each object in it has single property called 'Answer' which again a simple text representing how much someone likes something, represented with this type of answer ID 3 (RATING) and TYPE_ID Int- This is also an integer
representing what kind we are using for that question as I have used RATE in all questions. Now let us move on to the actual Questionnaire: { "data":{ "_TF\_QUESTIONNAIRES" : [ 5,[ {"CODE":"W01","NAME​ ​ ":

Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Environment with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this workplace environment survey is as follows - there are seven main categories, each containing several sub-questions to gather information related specifically within that category and its topic of 'workspace'. Each has a unique code (CODE), name or title displayed on the questionnaire page with an explanation about it in order not just make them more interesting but also easier for users who may want their input too.
The seven categories are: 1) "General Work Environment" - This category focuses primarily around general aspects of where people work, such as temperature and noise levels; this can have a significant impact on productivity if employees feel uncomfortable or distracted by external factors beyond control like poor air quality due to construction nearby etc.; questions under it include things about cleanliness/organization habits at home vs office space. 2) "Technology & Connectivity" - This category deals with technology and connects people together through various devices, software applications; this could be anything from email servers being down for hours causing communication delays between team members or even inadequate internet speeds which hinder remote work capabilities altogether! Questions under it would focus on things like preferred platforms/tools used daily by individuals. 3) "Health & Safety" - This category concentrates specifically around health and safety concerns within the workplace, including physical hazards present due to poor design layouts or even ergonomic chairs that don't support proper posture over time! Questions under it would focus on things like emergency procedures in case of accidents. 4) "Comfort & Amenities" - This category explores comfort and amenity aspects within the workplace, including seating arrangements for long hours spent sitting down during workdays; questions here will revolve around how comfortable employees feel with current settings available at their desks/cubicles etc..5 )-Environmental Factors & Sustainability" - This category highlights environmental factors and sustainabilty issues related to the workplace, including recycling programs implemented within offices or energy efficiency practices being followed; questions under it would focus on things like how much importance is given towards eco friendliness. 6) "Communication Styles/Preferences & Teamwork" - This category explores communication styles and preferences among team members in order to foster better collaboration, including language barriers present due lack of diversity within teams or even different time zones causing difficulties when scheduling meetings; questions under it would focus on things like preferred methods for sharing information. 7) "Personal Space & Privacy" - This category focuses primarily around personal space and privacy concerns at workplaces where people spend most their waking hours, including how much autonomy they have over own workspace design or if there are any restrictions placed upon them; questions under it would focus on things like whether individuals feel comfortable sharing certain information about themselves.
