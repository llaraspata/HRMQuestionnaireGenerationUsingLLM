Generate me a questionnaire on End of working relationship with 10 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this end-of-working-relationship evaluation is as follows - there are ten main topics, each represented by an object in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array. Each topic has a 'NAME', which represents its content or question; and also includes information about who that person worked with (if any) during their time at this company using properties like:
- TEAMWORK - to evaluate teamwork skills, including collaboration experiences within the workplace environment as well other colleagues involved in projects. This will help determine if there were conflicts between individuals which could negatively impact productivity or success of initiatives undertaken together with those people still working here today; and whether any specific person has been particularly helpful when it came time for them to leave their position, etcetera
- COMMUNICATION - this topic focuses on communication skills. It will ask about the effectiveness in conveying ideas clearly through various mediums such as email or phone conversations while also considering how well someone could listen and respond appropriately during meetings with team members; it'll be interesting to see what kind of feedback comes back regarding whether they felt heard, understood by others around them etcetera
- WORK ENVIRONMENT - this topic explores the physical work environment. It will ask if there were any issues related directly or indirectly due solely because certain conditions weren’t met (either personal preferences not being accommodated OR more systemic problems like temperature, noise level) that might have affected performance negatively; it's important for people to feel comfortable where they spend most of their waking hours so this section should provide insight into whether or not those needs were consistently fulfilled throughout tenure here at the company.
- WORKPLACE DIVERSITY - This topic explores workplace diversity and how well someone felt included in a diverse team, including any experiences with discrimination based on gender identity/expression, race etcetera; it's crucial to understand whether everyone feels welcome regardless of background or personal traits since this can greatly impact overall satisfaction levels.
- WORKPLACE CULTURE - This topic explores workplace culture and how well someone felt they fit into the company’s values system as a whole while working here, including any specific initiatives that were taken to make them feel part of something bigger than just their individual role within an organization; this is essential because if people don't identify with organizational goals then it becomes difficult for organizations achieve those objectives.
- WORKPLACE RELATIONSHIPS - This topic explores workplace relationships, including interactions between colleagues and supervisors during work hours as well outside of them too! It will be interesting to see how much time was spent building strong connections with others here at the company since these can often lead towards better collaboration outcomes.
- PERSONAL GROWTH & DEVELOPMENT - This topic explores personal growth and development opportunities provided by this organization, including whether someone felt they had enough chances for advancement or learning new skills that would benefit both themselves AND their employer; it's key to ensure people feel challenged intellectually while working here so we can keep them engaged long-term.
- WORK/LIFE BALANCE - This topic explores work life balance, including whether someone felt they had enough time for personal pursuits outside of the office environment and how much pressure was put on their family or friends due to job demands; it's important that people feel supported in all aspects of lives not just when at 'work'.
- JOB SECURITY - This topic explores feelings about employment security, including whether someone felt they could rely long term on this organization for income and career growth. It is essential to ensure employees have confidence their jobs will remain stable so we can retain top talent within our ranks! 	`JSON format of the questionnaire:

 Explanation: The structure I will use for this training effectiveness questionnaire is as follows - there are three main components, an explanation of which can be found below in JSON format (note that the specific answers to each individual question have not been included):- 'data' object containing a single property TF\_QUESTIONNAIRES: An array with only one element representing this particular training effectiveness survey. Each item within said ‘TF_ QUESTATIONAIRE’ has its own properties, including CODE (string), NAME(String) and TYPE ID.(int). The specific questions are contained in an object called '_ TF\_QUESTIONS' which is also included as a property of the questionnaire.- 'CODE': Unique code for each individual survey.
- ‘NAME’: Name or title given to this particular training effectiveness evaluation form, e.g., “Training Effectiveness Evaluation Form”. The name should be meaningful and informative about what type/kind is being evaluated by it so that people who see the document can understand its purpose without having access beforehand;
- ‘TYPE ID’: Unique identifier for each questionnaire format used, e.g., 3 if using a rating scale or numbered system where participants rate their agreement with certain statements on various topics related to training effectiveness.- '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects representing individual questions within the survey;- 'CODE' (string): Unique code for each question in this particular evaluation form.
- ‘NAME’: Text content or prompt displayed as part of a given assessment, e.g., “On a scale from 1 to 5 how would you rate your overall satisfaction with our training program?” The name should be clear and unambiguous about what is being asked so that people who see the document can understand its purpose without having access beforehand;
- ‘TYPE ID’: Unique identifier for each question format used, e.g., 3 if using a rating scale or numbered system where participants rate their agreement with certain statements on various topics related to training effectiveness.- 'DISPLAY ORDER' (int): Order in which questions appear within the survey;
- '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects representing individual answers given by respondents. This is not included as part of my JSON format because it would require specific responses, but I will provide some examples here: { "DISPLAY ORDER": 1, “CODE” :"Q02",
“NAME":"On a scale from one to five how likely are you to recommend this training program?”, ANSWER:"5 - Extremely Likely"}, etc. The admitted question types in my JSON format include: ID=3 (Rating Scale), where participants rate their agreement with certain statements on various topics related to the effectiveness of a given piece/programme;
ID = 4, which is used for acquiring feedback from people about something specific like training materials or methods. This type usually includes open-ended questions and may be more time consuming than other types but provides valuable insights into participant satisfaction levels with certain aspects that could then inform future improvements in those areas if necessary;
ID = 8, which is used when the answer to given question needs a date/time format rather than just text. This can help establish timelines and deadlines for projects or events based on responses received from participants about their availability during particular periods of time.- 'TF_QUESTIONS': An array containing two individual questions with following properties:
```json
{  "data": {    "_TFSURVEYTYPEID":3,    	"CODE":"TE01",     	   "NAME":"Training effectiveness evaluation form - Pre training course satisfaction survey (Version A)",       "__TF_QUESTIONS": [        {"DISPLAY ORDER":2,"__COPYFROMSTRING":true,"ANSWERS":[{"TYPE ID":3},

Generate me a questionnaire on Employee experience with 16 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this employee experience survey is as follows - there are sixteen different 'questions' in total, each represented as an object within '_TF_QUESTIONS'. Each of these objects has a unique code (CODE), the question content or text itself (NAME) and type ID. There isn’t one answer per person but rather several options to choose from with checkboxes for selection - this is why I have used 'TYPE\_ID' 3 in all cases, as it allows multiple answers selected by user before submitting survey.
Please find the JSON format of your questionnaire below:
```json
{    "data": {        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [            {"CODE":"1","NAME":"Employee experience - Q01",         "TYPE_ID":3,"DISPLAY_ORDER": 2,          "_TF_ANSWERS" : [{              "ANSWER": "<p>Strongly agree</p>"             },{

Generate me a questionnaire on Career Path Clarity with 10 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this career path clarity questionnaire is as follows - there are ten main 'questions' and each of these has several possible answers, which have been grouped into three categories. Each category also includes a brief description to help users understand what it means in more detail if they wish; the idea here being that people can select one or multiple options from any given section depending on how closely those statements align with their own feelings about career path clarity and personal growth, etcetera!

{   "data": {     "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [         {"CODE":"CPC1",         	"NAME":"How clear am I feeling today? (Rate 0-5)",              "TYPE_ID":3,            "_TfQuestions":[             {"CODE":"TPA264789","NAME":"Feeling very unclear about my career path at the moment. Can't see myself progressing or knowing what I want to do long term.",         	"DISPLAYORDER":10,"TYPE_ID":3,            "_TFAnswers":[              {"ANSWER":"Strongly agree"},                {"ANSWER":"Somewhat disagree"}             ]           },
```
&nbsp;    &nbsps;&nbsp;"CODE":"TPA264790",         	"NAME":"I feel like I have a good understanding of my career goals and aspirations.",            "DISPLAYORDER":1,      `TYPE_ID: 3`,       "_TFAnswers
```
[               {"ANSWER":"Strongly agree"},                   {"ANSWER":"Somewhat disagree"}              ]           },         ...]}}};   }"
}
Explanation of the questionnaire structure above - This is a JSON object containing an array called 'data'. In this case, there's only one element in that array: another nested JSON representing our career path clarity (CPC) survey. The CPC has several properties including its code and name as well as type ID set to 3 indicating it should be rated out of five possible answers; finally we have an object called '_TfQuestions' which contains all the questions in this particular questionnaire, each with their own unique codes for referencing later if needed.
```python
{   "data": {     "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [         {"CODE":"CPC1",         	"NAME":"How clear am I feeling today? (Rate 0-5)",           ...       },      ]}};    // This is the JSON object for our Career Path Clarity survey

Generate me a questionnaire on Career Path Clarity with 7 questions

-------------------

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this career path clarity questionnaire is as follows - there are seven main categories, each containing several sub-questions to gather information about the user's thoughts and feelings regarding their current job or future careers.

Generate me a questionnaire on Career Path Clarity with 10 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I have chosen for this career path clarity questionnaire is as follows - there will be an array of 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' which contains only one element representing the actual questionnaire. This single object has several properties including a code, name and type id (which in all cases here are 3). The most important property for each individual questions within this is '_tf\_questions', an array of objects that represent specific questions with their own unique codes as well as names to describe the content more fully. Each question also has its associated answer options stored under a key called '\_TF ANSWERS' and these are strings rather than just integers for greater flexibility in phrasing answers positively, or including additional information about each option such as why it might be considered correct/incorrect etc..

Generate me a questionnaire on Career Path Clarity with 9 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this career path clarity questionnaire is as follows - there are nine questions in total, each having specific properties and values to make it engaging yet informative enough that the user can understand their current state of mind regarding a certain topic. Each item has been designed with care while keeping human resource management field requirements at heart:
```json
{ "data": { 	"TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [    {      "CODE":"CPC01",     "NAME":"What is your current job title? (Multiple choice)",   "_TF_ANSWERS":[        {"ANSWER":"Student"},       ...            ]},
```
This first question asks about the user's current position in terms of a professional designation. The second one goes deeper into understanding whether someone feels they have reached their full potential or not:
```json	"NAME":"Do you feel like reaching your maximum career growth? (Yes/No)",   "TYPE_ID":2,  ...},"CPC03": {    "_TF_QUESTIONS":[      {"CODE":"CPC04",     NAME":"What is the highest education level completed by yourself?"
```
This question asks for an educational background with multiple choices available. The next one focuses on understanding whether someone has a clear career goal or not:
```json	"NAME":"Do you have any specific long-term professional goals? (Yes/No)",   "TYPE_ID":2,  ...},"CPC05": {    "_TF_QUESTIONS":[      {"CODE":"CPC06",     NAME":"What do people say about your skills and abilities in the workplace?"
```
This question is a bit more engaging as it asks for an assessment from others around them. The next one focuses on understanding whether someone has had any formal training related to their job or not:
```json	"NAME":"Have you ever received professional development/training that was specifically designed and delivered? (Yes/No)",   "TYPE_ID":2,  ...},"CPC07": {    "_TF_QUESTIONS":[      {"CODE":"CPC08",     NAME":"Do your current job responsibilities align with what you want to do in the future?"
```
This question is quite specific and asks whether someone's tasks match their aspirations. The next one focuses on understanding how satisfied a person feels about certain aspects of work:
```json	"NAME":"On scale 1-5, please rate your satisfaction with current job security?",   "TYPE_ID":3}, ...},"CPC09": {    "_TF_QUESTIONS":[      {"CODE":"CPC24",     NAME":"Do you feel like there is a clear path for career progression in the organization?"
```
This question asks about whether someone feels that their company offers opportunities to move forward. The last one focuses on understanding how much control over job tasks and responsibilities they have:
```json	"NAME":"On scale 1-5, please rate your autonomy at work?",   "TYPE_ID":3}]}
```

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below, you can find an example JSON object that represents a feedback mechanisms topic survey containing five different-type and engagingly formulated multiple choice (MC) or rating scale type ofquestions to enhance user engagement. The questionnaire content is structured as follows: the root element contains only one property 'data' which in turn has another single property called "TF\_QUESTIONNAIRES". This array consists now, for example purposes and simplicity reasons out of exactly ONE object that represents a feedback mechanisms topic survey with five questions (and their details) inside.

Generate me a questionnaire on Feedback Mechanisms with 9 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this feedback mechanisms questionnaire is as follows - there are nine (10) different types of multiple-choice and rating scale style format to keep the user engaged throughout. Each type has a unique code, name, display order number that determines its position in relation with other questions on same page or next/previous pages if more than one form used for this questionnaire; also there is an array called '_TF_ANSWERS' which contains all possible answers to each specific 'TYPE\_ID'.
Here it goes: 
{   "data": {    ...     "TF\_QUESTIONNAIRES": [      {        "_TITLE":"Feedback Mechanisms",         "-CODE-1023456789" : "",          "+NAME-FEEDBACKMECHANISMS" : 
            'Please rate your agreement with the following statements about feedback mechanisms:',           "TYPE\_ID": 3,        "_TF_QUESTIONS": [         {             "-CODE-102456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPRSTUVWXYZ" : "",            "+NAME-FEEDBACKMECHANISMS: Q1",           "TYPE\_ID": 3,          ...
```python    DISPLAY_ORDER': 1,        '_TF_ANSWERS' [      {         'CODE': '-A',       NAME': '<strong>Strongly agree</b>',     TYPE_ID': 2   },          ......            ]},            ...........          ],
```
} }"data": {"TF\_QUESTIONNAIRES": [{ "TITLE":"Feedback Mechanisms", "-CODE-1023456789": "", "+NAME-FEEDBACKMECHANISMS": 'Please rate your agreement with the following statements about feedback mechanisms:',
"TYPE_ID": 3, "_TF\_QUESTIONS": [{ "DISPLAYORDER': 1,"CODE":"+ANSWEROPTIONSTYPEOF QUESTION", NAME' : '<strong>Strongly agree</b>', TYPE ID ':' ,2 }, { ... ]}
}, {}]"data"}"> The questionnaire is structured as follows: - Title "Feedback Mechanisms". There are 9 questions in total, each with a unique code and name. Questions have multiple-choice or rating scale format to keep the user engaged throughout; display order number determines position of every specific 'TYPE\_ID' on same page if more than one form used for this questionnaire - "CODE": '-A', "+NAME': '<strong>Strongly agree</b>'", TYPE ID ": 2"
- The first multiple choice type format is: "-ANSWEROPTIONSTYPEOF QUESTION, NAME' : 'Do you think feedback mechanisms are important?<br><span id=102456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPRSTUVWXYZ>Strongly agree</b>', TYPE ID

 Explanation: The structure I will use for this health and safety measures questionnaire is as follows - there are five main categories, each containing one or more 'questions'. Each category has the following properties (note that TYPE_ID=3 in all cases):<br><Br>-'CODE': a unique code to identify it.<BR
    –NAME: The name of this questionnaire section/category. <BR> 
   -'_TF\_QUESTIONS’ : an array containing one or more 'questions'. Each has the following properties:-‘CODE’; (string) Unique identifier for that specific questions<Br>-'NAME':(String): The content of this question.<br><Br>&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp -
   '_TF\_ANSWERS’: an array containing one or more 'answers'. Each has a single property, ‘ANSWER’, which is (string) representing the answer to that specific questions. <BR> 
    –'DISPLAY_ORDER':(int): The order in which this question should be displayed.<br><Br>&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;<Br>Here’s an example of how I would structure a health and safety measures Questionnaire with five main categories:<br><Br>{ "data": {

Generate me a questionnaire on Health and Safety Measures with 7 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this health and safety measures questionnaire is as follows - there are seven main categories, each containing one or more 'questions'. Each category has the following properties (note that TYPE_ID=3 in all cases):<br><Br>- CODE
   NAME <BR>- QUESTIONS: an array of objects representing questions. In this case I will have only 1 question per main topic, but there could be more.<BR>    - Each 'question' object has the following properties:-CODE (unique to that particular health and safety measure)<Br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-NAME <br><Br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;-TYPE_ID: always 3 in this case as all questions are of type rating.<BR>    -DISPLAY ORDER. This is the order each question will be displayed to a user, and can vary from one person filling out<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;the form/questionnaire to another depending on their preferences or even how they feel at that particular moment in time about health & safety measures.<Br><br>-ANSWERS: an array of objects representing possible answers. In this case I will have only 1 answer per question, but there could be more if a range is required for the rating scale<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each 'answer' object has just one property - ANSWER (the content/text)
```json
{    "data": {        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [{            "CODE":"HSM",                "NAME": "Health and Safety Measures Questionnaire on a scale of 1 to 5, with one being the lowest safety measure rating possible.",                ,"TYPE_ID":3,

```
:"0"     }}   };    ```The questionnaire is now structured as requested. The questions are:<br><Br>1 - Is Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) provided and used by all employees?2- Are hand sanitizers available at every work station or in the immediate vicinity of each employee's workspace, with refills easily accessible to replenish them when needed??3
``` 4.   Does management ensure that social distancing guidelines are followed within your workplace environment and do they provide adequate space for this?5- Is there a system set up whereby employees can report any concerns about health & safety measures, without fear of reprisal or discrimination from their employer??6
``` 7.   Are all work stations cleaned regularly with disinfectant to prevent the spread and contraction of illnesses such as COVID-19?8 - Is there a system in place for employees who are feeling unwell, whereby they can take time off without being questioned or made uncomfortable about their health status??
```The questionnaire is designed so that all questions have an answer on the scale 0 to not at all (lowest rating) and five as highest. This will allow management a clear understanding of how safe employees feel in terms of these measures, with zero meaning they do NOT consider it important or necessary for their health & safety.<br><Br>I hope this questionnaire is helpful - please let me know if there are any changes you would like to make!

Generate me a questionnaire on Internal Mobility Opportunities with 6 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The following JSON object represents an internal mobility opportunities questionnaire, which is composed of six multiple-choice type (TYPE_ID = 3) and one free text answer type (DESCRIPTION=Use this type to aquire feedback.)questions. Each individual 'question' in the '_TF\_QUESTIONS’ array has a unique code ('CODE'), content or name, question ID/type ("TYPE"), display order (“DISPLAY ORDER”), as well as an optional list of answers for multiple-choice questions (‘_ANSWERS').
The six topics have been selected to provide insight into the internal mobility opportunities within a company and are structured with engaging syntax. The admitted types include: ID = 3, which is used when rating something; or typeID=4 that can be utilized in acquiring feedback from participants about their experiences regarding job rotation/internal movement inside an organization (either positive—such as availability of training programs for advancement and clear career paths with mentors available to help new employees grow into more senior roles, OR negative: lack thereof).
Questionnaire JSON structure is given below. Please note that the order in which questions appear can be adjusted according to your preference by changing their 'DISPLAY\_ORDER' values; this will not affect functionality but may enhance user engagement with certain topics being presented earlier than others if desired so they feel closer attention has been paid specifically towards those areas of interest:

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this internal mobility opportunities questionnaire is as follows - there are eight different type three (rating)questions, each having the properties 'CODE', 'NAME' and so forth. Each of these has a unique code to identify it from others; name gives information about what that particular ratingquestion wants users rate on scale one-ten etc.; TYPE\_ID is always equal to 3 as we are using only type three questions in this questionnaire, which means all eight will be rated by user with some answer.

Generate me a questionnaire on Internal Mobility Opportunities with 10 questions

-------------------

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this internal mobility opportunities questionnaire is as follows - there are ten different, engaging and well-structured multiple choice type ofquestions in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array. Each has a unique code (CODE), content or text displayed to participants(NAME) with corresponding answer options stored within an object inside another property called 'ANSWERS'.
Each question is also assigned its display order and associated TYPE\_ID for easy identification, as well the name of each option being presented in this example. The type IDs used are 3 (rating), which allows participants to rate something on a scale; types that allow users to choose one or more answers from lists have been avoided due to simplicity but can be easily added if required by you!
Please find below JSON format representation of the questionnaire:
```json
{    "data": {        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [{            "CODE": 1,                "NAME": "[IM] Internal Mobility Opportunities",                  	"TYPE_ID":3,             _"TF_ANSWERS": [],              "_TOTALCOUNTEDASVOTES":"0.5",

Generate me a questionnaire on Leadership Effectiveness with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this leadership effectiveness questionnaire is as follows - there are seven main categories, each represented by one of these types and containing three to five subquestions in the form of type ID=3. Each has a unique code (CODE), name displayed on screen ('NAME'), order it should be shown or asked first/second etc.,(DISPLAY_ORDER) as well as an array for possible answers (_TF\_ANSWERS).
Here is how I structured this questionnaire:
{    "data": {        "_TF\_QUESTIONNAIRES": [            {"CODE":"LEADERSHIP","NAME":"Leadership Effectiveness Questionnaire",        	"TYPE_ID":3,         	"DISPLAY_ORDER":102496578,"_TF\_ANSWERS":[                {                    "ANSWER":"Strongly agree"}            ],        },
```
       {"CODE":"LEADERSHIP","NAME":"Leadership Effectiveness Questionnaire",        	"TYPE_ID":3,         	"DISPLAY_ORDER":102496578,"_TF_ANSWERS":[                {                    "ANSWER":"Agree"}            ],        },
       {"CODE":"LEADERSHIP","NAME":"Leadership Effectiveness Questionnaire",        	"TYPE_ID":3,         	"DISPLAY_ORDER":102496578,"_TF_QUESTIONS":[                {                    "CODE":"LDRPPLCJKTNPRZRHSRVTCRFRVTXHR",           
             "NAME":"My leader values and recognizes my contributions to the team.",         	"TYPE_ID":3,        	        "DISPLAY_ORDER":1},                {                    "CODE":"LDRPPLCJKTNPRZRHSRVTCRFRVTXHR",           
             "NAME":"My leader communicates their vision and sets clear objectives.",         	"TYPE_ID":3,        	        "DISPLAY_ORDER":2},                {                    "CODE":"LDRPPLCJKTNPRZRHSRVTCRFRVTXHR",           
             "NAME":"My leader empowers me and givesme the autonomy to make decisions.",         	"TYPE_ID":3,        	        "DISPLAY_ORDER":3},                {                    "CODE":"LDRPPLCJKTNPRZRHSRVTCRFRVTXHR",           
             "NAME":"My leader provides me with the necessary resources and support to perform my job.",         	"TYPE_ID":3,        	        "DISPLAY_ORDER":4},                {                    "CODE":"LDRPPLCJKTNPRZRHSRVTCRFRVTXHR",           
             "NAME":"My leader is open and receptive to my ideas.",         	"TYPE_ID":3,        	        "DISPLAY_ORDER":5}                ]},       {"CODE":"LEADERSHIP","NAME":"Leadership Effectiveness Questionnaire",           ...    }]};
```The seven main categories are: values and recognizes contributions to the team; communicates vision & sets clear objectives, empowers with autonomy/resources for decisions making performance job etc., open receptive ideas. Each has a unique code (CODE), name displayed on screen ('NAME'), order it should be shown or asked first second third fourth fifth sixth seventh eighth ninth tenth eleventh twelfth thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth sixteenth seventeenth eighteenth nineteenth twentieth twentyfirst ("LDRPPLCJKTNPRZRHSRVTCRFRVTXHR") and an array for possible answers (_TF_ANSWERS).
Each answer object in the '_TF\_QUESTIONS' has a single property 'NAME', which is also displayed on screen. The order of questions can be changed by changing their display orders (DISPLAY ORDER) or simply moving them up/down within this array, as well! I have tried to make these categories and subquestions clear but simple for easy understanding while maintaining professionalism in language used throughout the questionnaire content step-by-step.

Generate me a questionnaire on Onboarding Experience with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this 'OnBoarding Questionnaire' is as follows - there are three main components in JSON format, which includes an array of only one element representing the actual survey and two other objects containing information about it. Here’s how they look like with their properties described below;
```json
{  "data": {    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [      {"CODE":"ONBOARDING","NAME":"OnBoarding Experience Questionnaire",        "TYPE_ID":3,          "_TFRATINGSQuestions": [{            "CODE":"OB102564789",              "NAME":"How would you rate your overall onboarding experience? ",                "ANSWEROPTIONS": [                    {"DISPLAYVALUE":"Very Good","ID_QUESTIONTYPE3":null},
```
- 'data' is an object that contains a single property called '_TF\_QUESTATIONNAIRES', which in turn includes the actual questionnaire. The name of this array does not matter, but it should be consistent throughout your application to refer back later if needed; for example: "OnBoardingQuestionnaires".
- 'TYPE_ID' is an integer that specifies what type or format a survey has and must always equal 3 in our case. This tells us this questionnaire will have questions with predefined answers, not just free text input fields like other types might; for example: "OnboardingQuestionnaires".
- '_TFRATINGSQuestions' is an array of objects representing each individual multiple choice or rating type (depends on 'TYPE_ID')question. Each question has the following properties - 	extends a string called ‘CODE’ that should be unique for every survey, but consistent within your application;
- A second property named "NAME" contains text content to display as part of this particular questions and must always end with either one or two dots (.) depending on whether it is complete sentence. For example: 'How would you rate the clarity of communication during OnBoarding process?'; 	extends a third integer value called ‘DISPLAY\_ORDER’ that specifies where in sequence should this question appear relative to others;
- A fourth property named '_TFRATINGANSWERS' is an array containing all possible answers for each individual multiple choice or rating type (depends on 'TYPE_ID')question. Each answer object has a single string value called ‘DISPLAYVALUE’ that represents the content of this particular option to display as part of its question;
- The admitted types are 1,2 and 3 where: ID = 1 means use only one predefined response per user for each individual multiple choice questions. For example - 'How do you rate your overall satisfaction with our onboarding process?';	extends a second type called ‘ID’ that equals to two which allows users selecting more than just single option from list of available choices;
- ID = 3 means use predefined responses per user for each individual rating question. For example - 'On scale of one (lowest) and ten(highest), how would you rate your overall onboarding experience?';	extends a third type called ‘ID’ that equals to three which allows users selecting only single option from list but with ability adding additional comments if desired;
- ID = 4 means use this format when acquiring feedback about specific aspects of the process. For example - 'Please rate your agreement or disagreement on following statements:';	extends a fourth type called ‘ID’ that equals to four which allows users selecting only single option from list but with ability adding additional comments if desired;
- ID = 5 means use this format when reordering items in the sequence. For example - 'Please rank these factors of onboarding process by their importance:';	extends a fifth type called ‘ID’ that equals to five which allows users selecting only single option from list but with ability adding additional comments if desired;
- ID = 6 means use this format when distributing weights across several items/options. For example - 'Please distribute points (10 maximum) between these factors of onboarding process:';	extends a sixth type called ‘ID’ that equals to six which allows users selecting only single option from list but with ability adding additional comments if desired;
- ID = 7 means use this format when cloning questions using templates. For example - 'Please answer following question again, as you did before:';	extends a seventh type called ‘ID’ that equals to seven which allows users selecting only single option from list but with ability adding additional comments if desired;
- ID = 8 means use this format when the answers are dates or date/time. For example - 'Please provide your preferred start and end time for onboarding process:';	extends a eighth type called ‘ID’ that equals to eight which allows users selecting only single option from list but with ability adding additional comments if desired;
- The last property is an integer value of the order in sequence this particular question should appear. For example - 'On scale one (lowest) and ten(highest), how would you rate your overall onboarding experience?';	extends a second type called ‘ID’ that equals to three which allows users selecting only single option from list but with ability adding additional comments if desired;
```json
            {"CODE":"OB10256479",              "NAME":"><strong>Onboarding Experience</stron... ... ,"DISPLAY_ORDER":3},          {    }]}}"data"`cambiar el nombre de la propiedad a 'questions' y no usar un array sino solo una pregunta
```
- The name of the property does not matter, but it should be consistent throughout your application to refer back later if needed; for example: "OnboardingQuestions". 	extends an integer value called ‘DISPLAY\_ORDER’ that specifies where in sequence this question appears relative to others. For instance - 'How would you rate the clarity of communication during OnBoarding process?';
- A second property named “NAME” contains text content with HTML tags for visual enhancement and must always end without any dots (.) at all; 	extends a third integer value called ‘DISPLAY\_ORDER’ that specifies where in sequence this question appears relative to others. For example - 'How would you rate the clarity of communication during OnBoarding process?';
- A fourth property named '_TFRATINGANSWERS' is an array containing all possible answers for each individual multiple choice or rating type (depends on ‘ID’)question with a single string value called “DISPLAYVALUE” that represents content to display as part of this particular question; 	extends the admitted types are: ID =1,2 and three where -
- The first option is use only one predefined response per user for each individual multiple choice questions. For example – 'How do you rate your overall satisfaction with our onboarding process?';
- A second type called ‘ID’ that equals to two which allows users selecting more than just single options from list of available choices; 	extends a third option is use predefined responses per user for each individual rating question. For example – 'On scale one (lowest) and ten(highest), how would you rate your overall onboarding experience?';
- The fourth type called ‘ID’ that equals to four which allows users selecting only single options from list but with ability adding additional comments if desired; 	extends a fifth option is use this format when reordering items in the sequence. For example – 'Please rank these factors of onboarding process by their importance:';
- The sixth type called ‘ID’ that equals to six which allows users selecting only single options from list but with ability adding additional comments if desired; 	extends a seventh option is use this format when cloning questions using templates. For example – 'Please answer following question again, as you did before:';
- The eighth type called ‘ID’ that equals to eight which allows users selecting only single options from list but with ability adding additional comments if desired; 	extends a ninth option is use this format when the answers are dates or date/time. For example – 'Please provide your preferred start and end time for onboarding process:';
- The last property of each answer object should be an integer value called ‘DISPLAYVALUE’ that represents content to display as part of its question; 	extends a second option is use this format when acquiring feedback about specific aspects. For example – 'Please rate your agreement or disagreement on following statements:';
- The third property for each answer object should be an integer value called ‘DISPLAYVALUE’ that represents content to display as part of its question; 	extends a fourth option is use this format when distributing weights across several items/options. For example – 'Please distribute points (10 maximum) between these factors:';
- The fifth property for each answer object should be an integer value called ‘DISPLAYVALUE’ that represents content to display as part of its question; 	extends a sixth option is use this format when cloning questions using templates. For example – 'Please select one from following options again, just like before:';
- The seventh property for each answer object should be an integer value called ‘DISPLAYVALUE’ that represents content to display as part of its question; 	extends a final option is use this format when the answers are dates or date/time. For example – 'Please provide your preferred start and end time:';
- The last property for each answer object should be an integer value called ‘DISPLAYVALUE’ that represents content to display as part of its question; 	extends a second option is use only one predefined response per user with ability adding additional comments if desired.

```json                 },               DISPLAY_ORDER:0            }          ],         _TF_ANSWERS':[             {              ANSWER:'StronglyAgree',              TEXT:"I have a very positive impression about the onboarding process"           },             {              ANSWER:'SomewhatPositiveButCouldBeBetter',
```
'The experience was good, but there is still room for improvement'. This answer option allows participants to express that they had an overall pleasant feeling towards their new job or company. It does not mean it’s perfect yet though! 5 = Strongly Agree and the text associated with this code would be 'I have a very positive impression about
the onboarding process' }, { ANSWER: "Neutral", TEXT:"The experience was neither good nor bad, just an average one". This answer option allows participants to express that they are indifferent towards their new job or company. It does not mean it’s perfect yet though! 5 = Strongly Agree and the text associated with this code would be 'I have a very positive impression about
the onboarding process' }, { ANSWER: "SomewhatNegativeButCouldBeWorse", TEXT:"The experience was bad, but there are things that could make it better". This answer option allows participants to express they had an overall unpleasant feeling towards their new job or company. It does not mean the worst possible outcome though! 5 = Strongly Agree and
the text associated with this code would be 'I have a very positive impression about the onboarding process' }, { ANSWER: "StronglyNegative", TEXT:"The experience was terrible, I do NOT recommend it to anyone". This answer option allows participants who had an overall unpleasant feeling towards their new job or company. It means that they did not like anything and would
not suggest this onboarding process for someone else 5 = Strongly Agree } ] }, { CODE: 'OnBoardingQuestionnaire', NAME:' On- board experience - First day at work ', TYPE_ID :3, _TF\_QUESTIONS':[{ QUESTION:"What was your first impression of the physical workspace?", ANSWER:{CODE

'FirstImpressionOfWorkspaceCode','TextForAnswer'. This question uses a rating scale to measure how positively someone perceives their experience. The answer options range from strongly disagree (1) through neutral(3), and all the way up to Strongly Agree, with 5 being an option for this type of survey item

Each question has its own unique code that can be referenced later if needed; it also contains name property which gives context to what is being asked about in the survey item and display order so we know where each fits within
the overall onboarding experience Questionnaire!

Generate me a questionnaire on Recognition and Rewards with 11 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this recognition and rewards themed questionnaire is as follows - there are eleven main 'questions' in total, each one represented within the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array. Each of these has a unique code (CODE), content or name (NAME) which should be engaging to keep participants interested while providing valuable information about their thoughts on recognition and rewards programs for employees at work - this is stored as 'ANSWER'.
Each question also includes the type ID, in line with your specification. The questions are displayed below:

 Explanation: The structure I will use for this satisfaction survey is as follows - there are five main categories, each containing two or three subcategories and corresponding specific yes-or-no type of answers to the same set of multiple choice options. This way we can get a more detailed picture about how satisfied people feel in different areas without having them answer too many questions:

Generate me a questionnaire on Smart working with 6 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this smart-working topic is as follows - there are six topics (questions) in total, and each has its own code name to distinguish it from the others; all of these objects fall under a single property 'data' which contains an array called '_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES', with only one element that represents this questionnaire.
The first object is also named as _TF\_QUESTATIONAIRE and has several properties like CODE, NAME (which are smart-working related), TYPE ID etc., to make it more engaging I have used different types of questions in the '_tf_answers' array - this will help users engage better.
Please find below JSON format for your questionnaire:

Generate me a questionnaire on WorkLife Balance with 6 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this work-life balance questionnaire is as follows - there are six different 'questions' in total, each represented within '_TF_QUESTIONS'. Each of these has properties such as CODE (unique to the specific question), NAME (the content or text used when asking a user that particular questions) and TYPE\_ID. The latter is an integer value which indicates what type this 'question' belongs - in my case, I have selected 3 because it allows for more engaging responses from users than just selecting one answer;
```json
{   "data": {     "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [         {"CODE":"WKLB01","NAME":"How do you feel about your work-life balance?",          ...,            "__tf\_answers":[             {"ANSWER":"Overall I am satisfied with my current situation"},             ....

Generate me a questionnaire on WorkLife Balance with 8 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this work-life balance questionnaire is as follows - there are eight different 'questions', each represented in an object within '_TF_QUESTIONS' array. Each of these objects has the following properties specified, which include a code and name to identify it easily when referencing later on:
{
  "data": {
    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [
      {
        'CODE': 'QL1', // unique identifier for this question in particular. Can be used as reference if needed, e.g., QL stands for Questionnaire about Life and the number is just an internal code to differentiate questions from each other within a single survey/questionnairre; all codes are also supposed to be UNIQUE
        'NAME': "How do you feel your work-life balance currently sits?", // name of this question, which will appear in front and can include any text. This is the QUESTION that user sees when filling out a survey/questionnaire! It should not contain anything else but actual content for end users to see
        'TYPE_ID': 3,// type identifier: use ID=1 (single select) or ID =2(multiple seletc), in this case it is single-select question. This means that only one answer can be selected from the list of possible answers provided below as '_TF\_ANSWERS'
        "_TF_QUESTIONS": [ // array containing all questions for a particular survey/questionnaire, each represented by an object with specific properties (see above) and this is also supposed to include only actual QUESTiONs that will be presented in front of end users. This means no other information or metadata should go here!
          {  'CODE':'QL1_Q0', // code for the question, which can then reference later on if needed (either as a single value OR part OF an array) and is supposed to UNIQUE within this survey/questionnaire. It does not have any other meaning but just internal use
            "NAME": 'Strongly agree - I am satisfied with my work-life balance', // name of the question, which will appear in front for end users when filling out a form and should be descriptive enough to understand what this particular answer is about. It can include any text but it's recommended not too long
            "TYPE_ID": 1,// type identifier: use ID=3 (rating) or other values as needed in the questionnaire/survey design process; all types are also supposed TO BE UNIQUE within this survey! This means that no two questions should have same 'type' value. It does not mean anything specific but just internal reference for a particular type of QUESTION
            "DISPLAY_ORDER": 1, // display order: it is an integer and can be used to sort the list/array in any way needed; this means that if there are multiple questions with same 'display\_order' value then they will appear together at specified place. It does not have a specific meaning but just internal use for ordering
            "_TF_ANSWERS": [ // array containing all possible answers to be presented as options when filling out the survey/questionnaire; it is also supposed TO INCLUDE ONLY actual values and no other information or metadata should go here!

 Explanation: The structure I will use for this workload management questionnaire is as follows - there are seven main sections, each containing several properties including 'CODE', 'NAME' and so forth to represent the details of that section. Each property has a specific meaning attached in order to create an engaging yet informative set of questions with varied syntax:
```json
{    "data": {        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [            {"CODE":"WORKLOAD1",        	"NAME":"Workload Management - General Overview","TYPE_ID": 3,                "__TITLE__COLLAPSED__STYLESHEET___CSSCLASS____COLUMN0": "How do you feel about your work? Do the tasks and responsibilities assigned to
```
you make a priority in terms of time management or is it something that makes you uncomfortable because there are too many things on top without enough resources available for completion?"},"_TF\_ANSWERS":[{"CODE":"WORKLOAD1A","NAME":"I feel comfortable with the amount and type of work I am currently handling. The tasks assigned to me fit well within my capabilities, time management skills etc., so that there is a good balance between professional responsibilities
```
and personal life.", "ANSWER":true}, {"CODE":"WORKLOAD1B","NAME":"I feel uncomfortable with the amount and type of work I am currently handling. The tasks assigned to me do not fit well within my capabilities, time management skills etc., so that there is a poor balance between professional responsibilities
```
and personal life.", "ANSWER":false}, {"CODE":"WORKLOAD1C","NAME":"I feel like the amount of work I am handling now will be sustainable in long term without causing burnout or other negative effects on my health and wellbeing", "ANSWER":true},"CO...```
,{"CODE":"WORKLOAD7A","NAME":"Do you have access to tools that help manage your time effectively? (e.g., software for scheduling tasks)", 	"TYPE_ID":1}, {"DISPLAY_ORDER":0}]}}}`copieddecoded content: {    "data":{        "_TF\_QUESTIONNAIRES":[            {"CODE":"WORKLOAD7","NAME
```
The seven questions are as follows - note that the 'ANSWER' property is not included in this example, but would be used to record a user’s response: 1. "Do you have access to tools (either manual or digital) which help manage your time effectively? For instance – software for scheduling tasks?";
2. Are there any particular techniques that work best when it comes down prioritizing and organising the different elements of a project, such as using sticky notes on walls instead of just relying solely upon memory recall or digital reminders?; 3. Is your time management strategy effective in ensuring you have enough personal space to avoid feeling overwhelmed by professional responsibilities?
4 . Do tasks get completed within an acceptable amount of turnaround without causing undue stress, and if not what could be done differently?";5."Do the tools used for workload manage help with prioritising time effectively or do they cause more problems than solutions when it comes to managing a heavy load?;6. Is there enough flexibility in your current schedule that allows you
```yet still have some free moments, and if not what could be done differently?";7."Do the tools used for workload management help with prioritising time effectively or do they cause more problems than solutions when it comes to managing a heavy load? Is there enough flexibility in your current schedule that allows you
```to still have some free moments, and if not what could be done differently?";8.

Generate me a questionnaire on Workload Management with 7 questions

-------------------

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this workload management questionnaire is as follows - there are seven main categories, each containing one or more 'questions'. Each category has its own code and name (which in turn can contain multiple sub-categories). Questions have a unique identifier ('CODE'), content/text of the questions themselves ("NAME"), type_id to determine whether it's single select question etc., display order which will be used for organizing these on UI, as well as array containing all possible answers.
Here is your workload management questionnaire:

Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Culture with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this workplace culture questionnaire is as follows - there are seven main categories, each represented by one 'CODE' and its corresponding name in NAME format; the type of these individual items can vary. Each category has a list associated with it under '_TF_QUESTIONS', which contains several properties such as CODE (unique to that question), TYPE\_ID(which is equal 3 for all questions, since we are using only rating-based options here) and NAME containing the actual text of each item.

{   "data": {     ...      ,    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [          [{            "CODE":"WORKPLACE\_CULTURE1",             "NAME":"How would you rate your overall satisfaction with this workplace's culture? (scale: 0-5)",              "TYPE\_ID":3,               "_TF\_ANSWERS":[                 {                    ...
```yml            }]          },         {"CODE":"WORKPLACE_CULTURE2",             "NAME":"How would you rate the communication in this workplace? (scale: 0-5)",              "TYPE_ID":3,               "_TF_ANSWERS":[                 {                    ...
```
---------------------"DISPLAY\_ORDER":1,"CODE":"WORKPLACE\_CULTURE2.A","NAME":"Effectiveness of communication in my team",...}],},{"CODE":"WORKPLACE\_CULEATRE3", "NAME":"How would you rate the level of collaboration and cooperation among employees? (scale: 0-5)",
"TYPE\_ID":3, "_TF\_ANSWERS":[ { ... }] }, {"CODE":"WORKPLACE_CULTURE4","NAME":"Do your values align with those promoted by this workplace?(yes/no) ", "TYPE\_ID":2,"DISPLAY\_ORDER":10
---------------------"CODE":"WORKPLE\_CULUTRE5", "NAME":"How would you rate the level of support and encouragement provided to employees? (scale: 0-5)",
```yml    ...   }],{"CODE":"WORPLACE_CU...                     }, {"CODE":            "WORKPLACEXE6","NAME":"Do people feel comfortable being themselves in this workplace?(yes/no) ",             "TYPE\_ID":2,               "_TF_ANSWERS":[
```
---------------------"DISPLAY\_ORDER":1,"CODE":"WORP...                    ...}],{"CODE":"WORKPLACE6", "NAME":"How would you rate the level of innovation and creativity in this workplace? (scale: 0-5)",
"TYPE\_ID":3, "_TF_ANSWERS":[ { ... }] }, {"COD..."}]   }}
```python}
In total there are seven questions with different types. The first question is a rating scale from one to five and the rest of them have yes/no answers or multiple choice options (with 0-5 points assigned). This structure allows us not only get numerical values but also understand how people feel about certain aspects in their workplace, which can be used for further analysis if needed.

Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Culture with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this workplace culture questionnaire is as follows - there are seven main categories, each represented by an object in 'TF_QUESTIONS' array and containing the following properties. Each property has a corresponding value that represents its content or type ID (for example 1 means it’s first choice from list).
- CODE: A unique code for every question; this is generated based on topic, display order etc but not shown to end user in final format as I will generate those automatically. This can be a string and length of the strings varies depending upon content used within them - e.g., some may only need 5 characters while others might require more than twenty for example
- NAME: The name or text prompt displayed on screen; this should vary according to topic, display order etc but also remain sensitive not offensive so as many people are consulted about what wording they prefer before finalising. This can be a string and length of the strings varies depending upon content used within them - e.g., some may only need 5 characters while others might require more than twenty for example
- TYPE_ID: Represents type or format in which question is presented; this should vary according to topic, display order etc but also remain sensitive not offensive so as many people are consulted about what wording they prefer before finalising. This can be an integer and values range from 1 (first choice) upwards depending upon content used within them
- DISPLAY_ORDER: Represents position in which question appears; this should vary according to topic, display order etc but also remain sensitive not offensive so as many people are consulted about what wording they prefer before finalising. This can be an integer and values range from 1 (first) upwards depending upon content used within them
- _TF_ANSWERS: An array of objects; each representing a possible answer to the question in form that user will see on screen with following property - ANSWER, which is string containing text prompt displayed for given response option. This can be an integer and values range from 1 (first choice) upwards depending upon content used within them
Here’s my JSON format of this workplace culture questionnaire:
```json

Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Environment with 6 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this workplace environment questionnaire is as follows - there are six different 'TYPE_ID's, each one representing another type of interaction and the number increasing from left to right. Each object in '_TF\_QUESTIONS', which represents a single prompt or statement that needs an answer given by user input (either through text box/selection), has its own properties such as CODE for unique identification; NAME is what's displayed on screen, and TYPE_ID corresponds to the type of interaction.
The '_TF\_ANSWERS', which contains all possible answers in array format with ANSWER representing content shown when selected by user input (either through text box/selection), also has its own properties such as CODE for unique identification; NAME is what's displayed on screen, and TYPE_ID corresponds to the type of interaction.
The admitted question types are 1=Selection from a list with single answer choice allowed - ID:2 means multiple answers can be chosen instead if desired by user input (either through text box/selection). The other 'TYPE\_IDs' represent different interactions such as rating something, acquiring feedback etc., and the syntax of each question is varied to enhance engagement.
The topic for this specific workplace environment survey consists 6 questions: - "My work desk should be located near a window" (RATING) with display order set at number one; "- I feel comfortable speaking my mind in meetings if there are people present who may not agree with me, even when it's clear that others do NOT share this sentiment."(FEEDBACK\_TEXTBOXES), which is question type 4 and has a unique code of '123', NAME: "Do you feel comfortable speaking your mind in meetings if there are people present who may not agree with me, even when it's clear that others do NOT share this sentiment?"; "- I enjoy having my own personal work space" (RATING) is question type 5 and has a unique code of '402', NAME: "Do you prefer to have your own workspace instead of sharing the same area with someone else?", DISPLAY\_ORDER set at number two, '- My employer should provide me ergonomic equipment if needed' (SELECTION) is question type 1 and has a unique code '503', NAME: "Do you believe employers have an obligation to supply their employees with necessary Ergo-equipment?", DISPLAY\_ORDER set at number three, '- I like it when my work environment smells good' (RATING) is question type 6 and has a unique code of '504', NAME: "Do you think that the smell in your workplace can affect productivity?"; "- My office should be quiet"(SELECTION), which represents another interaction, this time with multiple choices allowed by user input (either through text box/selection). It's question type 2 and has a unique code of '501', NAME: "Do you think that noise level in your workplace can affect productivity?";
The JSON format for the survey is as follows - please note this only includes one single element, which represents an entire prompt or statement with all its properties included within it. This structure allows easy addition and removal of questions without having to reformat everything else: { "data": {"TF\_QUESTIONNAIRES": [

You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire specifying the topic and the number of questions.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.

 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Environment with 7 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this workplace environment questionnaire is as follows - there are seven different 'questions' and each has its own properties such as code, name (the actual text of the survey item), type ID to indicate whether it allows one or multiple answers etc., display order which determines where in a list that particular piece should be placed.
Each answer also gets assigned an ANSWER property containing just plaintext string content for ease-of use when reading results later on! Here's what I came up with:
```json
{  "data": {    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [      {"CODE":"WKPLCE1","NAME":"Workplace Environment Survey",        "TYPE_ID":3,          "_TF_ANSWERS": [],            "_TG_QUESTIONS":[                {"DISPLAY_ORDER":2,"CODE":"JOBSECURITY","NAME":"Do you feel secure in your current job? ",                    "REQUIRED":true,"MULTISELECT":false,"TYPE_ID":1,          _TF_ANSWERS: [            {              ANSWER:"Yes"                },{
```
