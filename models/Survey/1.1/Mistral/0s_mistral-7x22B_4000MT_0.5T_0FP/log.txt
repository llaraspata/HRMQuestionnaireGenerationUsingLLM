 "NAME": "Training Effectiveness",
 "TYPE_ID": 3,

 "NAME": "How would you rate the overall effectiveness of the training program?",
 "TYPE_ID": 3,
 "DISPLAY_ORDER": 1,
 "_TF_ANSWERS": [
 {
 "ANSWER": "Very effective"
 },
 {
 "ANSWER": "Somewhat effective"
 },
 {
 "ANSWER": "Somewhat ineffective"
 },
 {
 "ANSWER": "Very ineffective"
 }
 ]
 },
 {
 "CODE": "Q002",
 "NAME": "How well did the training program meet your specific needs?",
 "TYPE_ID": 3,
 "DISPLAY_ORDER": 2,
 "_TF_ANSWERS": [
 {
 "ANSWER": "Completely met my needs"
 },
 {
 "ANSWER": "Somewhat met my needs"
 },
 {
 "ANSWER": "Did not meet my needs"
 }
 ]
 },
 {
 "CODE": "Q003",
 "NAME": "How well do you think the training program can be applied to your job?",
 "TYPE_ID": 3,
 "DISPLAY_ORDER": 3,
 "_TF_ANSWERS": [
 {
 "ANSWER": "Can be applied very well"
 },
 {
 "ANSWER": "Can be applied with some modifications"
 },
 {
 "ANSWER": "Cannot be applied at all"
 }
 ]
 },
 {
 "CODE": "Q004",
 "NAME": "How would you rate the usefulness of the training program for your job?",
 "TYPE_ID": 3,
 "DISPLAY_ORDER": 4,
 "_TF_ANSWERS": [
 {
 "ANSWER": "Very useful"
 },
 {
 "ANSWER": "Somewhat useful"
 },
 {
 "ANSWER": "Not useful at all"
 }
 ]
 }
 ]
 }
 }

The questionnaire has 4 questions, each with a code, name, and type ID. The type ID is used to determine the type of question and the answers are provided in a separate array.

Questions are displayed in a specific order and the answer options are also provided in a specific order. The answer options are provided as strings, which can be used to determine if the answer is a number, date, or something else.

The questions ask about the overall effectiveness, how well the training met specific needs, how well the training can be applied to a job, and how useful the training is. These questions can help determine the effectiveness of a training program and if there are areas for improvement.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation:
This questionnaire is structured as a JSON object, where the 'data' property contains an array of questionnaires. In this case, there is only one questionnaire, which is an array containing the following properties: 'CODE', 'NAME', 'TYPE_ID', '_TF_QUESTIONS', and '_TF_ANSWERS'.

The '_TF_QUESTIONS' array contains an array of questions, and each question has the following properties: 'CODE', 'NAME', 'TYPE_ID', 'DISPLAY_ORDER'.

The 'ANSWERS' property is not included in the question object because this questionnaire is a rating question, and the answer is given as a number, not selected from a list of options.

{
 "data": {
 "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [
 {
 "CODE": "ACCESSTOTECHNOLOGYANDTOOLS",
 "NAME": "Access to Technology and Tools",
 "TYPE_ID": 3,
 "_TF_QUESTIONS": [
 {
 "DISPLAY_ORDER": 1,
 "CODE": "QUESTION1",
 "NAME": "On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate the accessibility of technology and tools in your workplace?",
 "TYPE_ID": 3
 }
 ]
 }
 ]
}

The question prompts the user to rate the accessibility of technology and tools in their workplace on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being very poor and 10 being very good. This will help to measure the user's perception of accessibility and if there are any barriers to access.

- 'CODE': (string) 'CAREER_PATH_CLARITY'
- 'NAME': (string) 'Career Path Clarity Questionnaire'
- 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
- '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of only one element, which represents a question.

The question in '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
- 'CODE': (string) 'Q0001'
- 'NAME': (string) 'Do you feel that your current job aligns with your long-term career goals?'
- 'TYPE_ID': (int) 3
- 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) 1
- '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of only one element, which represents a possible answer to the question.

The answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.

Questionnaire:
{
 "data": {
 "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [
 {
 "CODE": "CAREER_PATH_CLARITY",
 "NAME": "Career Path Clarity Questionnaire",
 "TYPE_ID": 3,
 "_TF_QUESTIONS": [
 {
 "CODE": "Q0001",
 "NAME": "Do you feel that your current job aligns with your long-term career goals?",
 "TYPE_ID": 3,
 "DISPLAY_ORDER": 1,
 "_TF_ANSWERS": [
 {
 "ANSWER": "Yes, I feel that my current job is aligned with my long-term career goals"
 },
 {
 "ANSWER": "No, I do not feel that my current job is aligned with my long-term career goals"
 },
 {
 "ANSWER": "I am not sure if my current job is aligned with my long-term career goals"
 }
 ]
 }
 ]
 }
}

This questionnaire aims to understand how well a person's current job aligns with their long-term career goals. The question is phrased in a way that encourages introspection and self-awareness about the alignment of their job with their career goals. The three possible answers allow participants to express a clear opinion about the alignment of their job with their career goals, or to indicate uncertainty.

{
'ANSWER': 'The current feedback system needs some improvements, but it is still useful.'
},
{
'ANSWER': 'The current feedback system is not useful and needs to be replaced.'
}
]
},
{

'TYPE_ID': 3,
'DISPLAY_ORDER': 2,
'_TF_ANSWERS': [
{
'ANSWER': 'Very easy to use and navigate.'
},
{
'ANSWER': 'Somewhat easy to use, but a few improvements could be made.'
},
{

'CODE': 'QUESTION_3',
'NAME': 'How well do you think the current feedback system encourages open communication?',
'TYPE_ID': 3,
'DISPLAY_ORDER': 3,
'_TF_ANSWERS': [
{
'ANSWER': 'The feedback system encourages open communication and transparency.'

{
'ANSWER': 'The feedback system somewhat encourages open communication, but more could be done.'

This questionnaire consists of 4 questions with 3 possible answers for each question.
The answers are displayed in a more engaging way, using sentences that describe the level of satisfaction with the feedback system.
The questions are displayed in order of display order, and the type of question is rated, as it is a more subjective type of question.
The 4 questions are designed to gather specific feedback about the feedback system and its effectiveness, ease of use, encouragement of open communication, and fairness.

You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire about a specified topic.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
