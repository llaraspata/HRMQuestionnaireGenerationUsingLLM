     - System: 
You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire specifying the topic and the number of questions.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.

Please help me understand why the value of 43 is not being used as a number but instead it's treated like an object? I am trying to learn about JavaScript and how objects work. Thank you! < /p> In this specific context, `43` is likely interpreted as an integer (number) rather than an "object". However the reason why 43 cannot be used directly in a code snippet provided by someone else might not have been specified clearly enough or it could simply just be that they are using some other value for their example.
It's also possible to define object with key-value pair where `"__TYPEID__"` is the name of an "object", and 43 would then become a property (or attribute) associated with this particular type/class, but without seeing more code it can be difficult to give specific answer.
If you could provide additional context or information about what specifically happens when using `"__TYPEID__"` as object name in JavaScript I'd happy try help further!

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this remote work experience survey is as follows - there are ten main categories, each represented in JSON format and containing various properties such as code (unique identifier), name of the category or topic being asked about, type id indicating whether it's a multiple choice question with one answer selected from many options available; if so then Type_ID would be 1. If more than once selection is allowed for this option - in that case we will use "2" as value and display order which indicates the position of each category or topic on survey form

The company also supports me with this.", "No, my future is uncertain at work as well as outside of it."]    },"_TF\_QUESTIONSTYPES": {        "_TFCAREERPATHCLARITYTYPECOUNT": 10      },  	"DISPLAYORDER":23} ]}}

```
This JSON object contains a single questionnaire with the code "CP". The name of this quesstionaire is 'Career path clarity for employees in the organization'. It has ten questions, each represented by an entry under `_TF_QUESTIONS`. Each one will be presented to participants as:
```json
{     "_TFSPECIALTYPES": {         "CPCODE1":"Yes",         	"NAME":"Does this company provide a clear career path for me?","DISPLAYORDER":23,"ANSWEROPTIONCOUNT": 4,      },   }
```
The question is: 'Does the organization offer you an obvious and well-defined progression in your professional life?'. The possible answers are Yes/No with four levels of certainty for each answer (Strongly agree / Agree / Disagree or Strong disagree). This will be repeated ten times, changing only `NAME` property to match the question text:
```json
{     "_TFSPECIALTYPES": {         "CPCODE2":"Yes",         	"NAME":"Do I know what my next step should be in terms of career progression?","DISPLAYORDER":31,"ANSWEROPTIONCOUNT": 4,      },   }
```
The second question is: 'Am I aware about the steps that need to happen for me on a professional level?'. The possible answers are again Yes/No with four levels of certainty (Strongly agree / Agree / Disagree or Strong disagree). This will be repeated ten times, changing only `NAME` property in each entry:
```json
{     "_TFSPECIALTYPES": {         "CPCODE3":"Yes",         	"NAME":"Do I feel that my career progression is supported by the company?","DISPLAYORDER":40,"ANSWEROPTIONCOUNT": 2,      },   }
```
The third question: 'Is there a clear path for me to follow in this organization?'. The possible answers are Yes/No with four levels of certainty (Strongly agree / Agree / Disagree or Strong disagree). This will be repeated ten times changing only `NAME`. And so on, until the tenth question:
```json
{     "_TFSPECIALTYPES": {         "CPCODE10":"Yes",         	"NAME":"Do I feel that my career progression is supported by this company?","DISPLAYORDER":23,"ANSWEROPTIONCOUNT": 4,      },   }

Generate me a questionnaire on Internal Mobility Opportunities with 8 questions

-------------------

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this internal mobility opportunities questionnaire is as follows - there are eight different type three (rating)questions, each having the properties 'CODE', 'NAME' and so forth. Each of these has a unique code to identify it from others; name gives information about what that particular rating questions wants you rate on scale one-ten for example or any other number range with specific min/max values if required - this will help keep things organized in case multiple people are filling out same questionnaire at different times.
Here is the JSON representation of your internal mobility opportunities eight type three (rating)question Questionnaire:
{ "data": { 	"TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [    {        "_TITLE": null,        ,"CODE":"INTERNALMOBILITY",             ​​     "NAME":"Internal Mobility Opportunities - Rate your satisfaction with the following aspects of internal mobility on a scale from one to ten (10 being most satisfied):

	"TYPE_ID":3,         "_TF_QUESTIONS": [            {               "CODE":"TRAININGPROGRAM1",              "NAME":"Availability and variety of training programs - rate your satisfaction on a scale from one to ten (ten being most satisfied)",             ​​    	"TYPE_ID":3,             "_TF\_ANSWERS": [                    {                "CODE":"T0256",

Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Culture with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this workplace culture questionnaire is as follows - there are seven main categories, each represented in JSON format and containing specific properties such as code, name, type ID (which determines the kind of interaction), display order to determine where it appears on a form or survey page if necessary.
Each category has several questions associated with its topic; these too have certain required fields like CODE for unique identification purposes while NAME refers directly back towards content/text displayed within that particular questionnaire item, and TYPE ID which again determines how users can interact whether through selection of one answer from a list (ID: 1), multiple answers possible if so desired by user(s) or not just single choice allowed then it'd be represented with an '3', etc.
Lastly but importantly DISPLAY ORDER field is used to order questions within their respective categories, ensuring logical flow and progression throughout the entire questionnaire:

```python
This questionnaire has 8 questions, each with a Likert scale of options from "strongly disagrees" (1) to strongly agrees. The topics are:  
- Inclusivity and acceptance in the workplace culture;   
- Encouragement for individuality within that environment;    
- Transparency/honesty about how things work, including communication style preferences or decision making processes used by leaders of an organization  (1=Strongly disagree);     	
   - Supportiveness towards all employees and their needs as well. This could include providing resources such as training programs if necessary so that everyone can perform at a high level without feeling left out because they lack certain skills;   
- Openness to new ideas, perspectives or opinions from others in the workplace culture (1=Strongly disagree);    	  - Respectfulness and consideration towards all employees within this environment. This includes being polite when speaking with someone else even if there is disagreement about something specific like job responsibilities;   
   - Collaboration between team members, which can lead to better problem solving abilities because it allows people who have different strengths/weaknesses or skill sets work together more effectively than they would alone. It also helps build relationships among coworkers so that trust and understanding are present when working on projects with tight deadlines;   
   - Empowerment through opportunities for growth, such as promotions based off performance metrics rather just time served in a position which may not be equitable if certain individuals do better than others due to personal circumstances outside of work. This questionnaire is designed so that people can evaluate their workplace culture and make improvements where necessary
