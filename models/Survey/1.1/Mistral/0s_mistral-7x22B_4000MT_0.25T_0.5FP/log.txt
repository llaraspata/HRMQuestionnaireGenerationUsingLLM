Generate me a questionnaire on Stress at work

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: 
The structure I will use for this stress-at-work questionnaire is as follows:
1 code (stress_questionnaire) and name ("Stress Questionnaire") are given to the whole set of questions. The type ID equals 3, which means that it's a rating scale test with six different levels from "Almost never" to "Fairly often." There will be ten separate questions in this questionnaire for stress at work; each one has its unique code and name as well:
- Question Code (TF_QUESTION) is the same as type ID. The NAME property contains a short description of what that particular question tries to measure, while DISPLAY ORDER gives information about where it will be displayed in this test if there are other questions present before or after; finally TYPE\_ID equals 3 because all these ten items have similar structure and purpose (to rate something).
- The last property is ANSWERS. It contains six possible answers for every question, as the type of scale used here requires it: from "Almost never" to "Fairly often." Each answer has its own code in form 'ANSWER\_CODE' that corresponds with a particular level on our stress-at work test (from 1 - almost never and up till number six – fairly often).
The questions are as follows, each one having the same structure:
```json
{
    "data": {   "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES" : [     {        ...         ,          "__TEMPLATE__ID":"stress",            __CODE:"STRESS01",                _NAME":"Does your environment seem to be a pressure cooker?"                     ,"DISPLAY ORDER":2,
```
(This question is the second one in this test) "TYPE\_ID" :3}, { ... } , etc. until ten questions are listed with their codes and names (for example: Does it ever happen that you find yourself feeling tense or uptight at work?), display order from 1 to 5, type ID is always three because all of these items have similar structure)
```json"_TF_QUESTIONS": [    {        "__TEMPLATE__ID":"stress",            __CODE:"STRESS02",               _NAME":"Do you feel that there are constant last-minute pressures and changes?"                     ,"DISPLAY ORDER":3,
``  "TYPE\_ID" :3},     ...   ]}    }`
```json: The ten questions with their codes (STRESS01 to STRESS10), names of each question in NAME property as well display order from one till six and type ID that is always three are listed. Each item has the same structure, only difference between them lies within text content which I tried my best not just copy-paste but make it more human friendly for better user engagement

 Explanation: Below I have formatted a JSON object that represents an end-of-working relationships survey with 10 engaging and thoughtful multiple choice questions, including rating scale options to capture valuable feedback from employees about their experiences at the company. The 'TYPE_ID' for each question is either 3 or 4 depending on whether it asks participants to rate something (type=3) versus providing open-ended text responses through a comment box with prompts included in every questions prompt, which helps elicit more detailed and specific feedback from respondents about their experiences at the company.

Generate me a questionnaire on Manager feedback

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below, you will find an example JSON object that represents a manager-feedback specific employee evaluation form (questionnaire). The 'data' property contains one element in its array called '_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES', which is the only thing required. This single questionnaire has several properties including code and name for identification, type ID 3 because it requires employees to rate something about their manager(s), a display order that determines where this form appears among other forms if multiple exist in an organization's assessment battery, as well as '_TF_QUESTIONS'. The questions array includes five objects representing individual evaluation statements with specific codes and types. Each question has the same type ID 3 for consistency purposes since we want employees to rate their managers based on these prompts using a scale of Strongly Disagree (1) through Strongly Agree(5).

{   "data": {    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [        true,        0: {"CODE":"MANAGERFEEDBACK",            "NAME": "[U] Manager Feedback Form - Employee Evaluation of Managers Questionnaire (2/14)",             "TYPE_ID": 3,"DISPLAYORDER": 5},

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you can find an example JSON object that represents a structured employee experience feedback type Questionnaire, which is composed out from several types of Questions and Answers to those questions in order for the user filling it be able to express their opinion about certain topics. The question's code should reflect its place within this specific structure so as not to interfere with other parts or create confusion when trying to interpret results later on, while still being easily understood by people who will use them during analysis process; each one also has a name associated which makes it easier for users filling out the form because they know exactly what information is required from their perspective too.

The questionnaire I am generating for you is called 'Employability Potential Questionnaire (EPQ)'. It has a type ID of three, which means it will contain rating questions. The '_TF_TEMPLATEQuestions' array contains the following objects representing each individual template:<br><span id="REPLACEMENT">    {

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you can find an example JSON structure for creating a Questionnaire in Human Resource Management field, specifically focused on "Career path clarity". This topic is approached with different types of questions to gather information about the employee's career growth and aspirations. The question order has been designed considering that people tend firstly answer general open-ended or multiple choice type questions before moving onto more specific ones like rating scales, which can be perceived as less intrusive if they are not fully focused on a topic yet:
```json
{    "data": {        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [            {"CODE":"CPC01","NAME":"Personal career goals",                "TYPE_ID":3,                  	"DISPLAY_ORDER":25,                    	"_TF_ANSWERS":[
          ]},              {... more questions ...}        ],           }    }}
```
Questionnaire: Career Path Clarity (CPC01) - Personal career goals. This question is a rating scale type with 3 options and display order of the first one to be asked in this example, as it can help understand better how people perceive their future growth opportunities within an organization or if they are looking for external factors:
```json
{    "CODE":"CPC01",  	"NAME": "Personal career goals - Rating scale question with 3 options and display order of the first one to be asked in this example, as it can help understand better how people perceive their future growth opportunities within an organization or if they are looking for external factors.",   
        "_TF_ANSWERS": [            {"CODE":"CPC01A","DISPLAYORDER": 25,"NAME": "I am very satisfied with my current career path and feel it is taking me to where I want in terms of position, salary etc. - Strongly agree"},                  	"TYPE_ID":3},
        "_TF_QUESTIONS": [            {"CODE":"CPC01A","NAME": "I am very satisfied with my current career path and feel it is taking me to where I want in terms of position, salary etc. - Strongly agree",                  	"TYPE_ID":3},
        ]    }
```
Questionnaire: Career Path Clarity (CPC02) – Listing possible roles within the organization that could be a fit for an employee's career growth and asking them to select all those they feel would make sense. This question is of type ID 5, reordering items as it can help understand better how people perceive their future opportunities:
```json

     - Question number: 5
-------------------
[PROMPTS]
     - System: 
You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire about a specified topic.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below, you will find an example JSON object that represents a structured employee motivational questionnaire with 10 engaging and thought-provoking questions to assess factors contributing towards intrinsic work satisfaction for employees in various industries or organizations. The 'TYPE_ID' values are used as described above but the other properties have been tailored specifically for this purpose, using varied syntax within NAME property strings of both question types (ratings) and answers ('ANSWER') to maintain user engagement while adhering strictly to your format requirements:
```json
{  "data": {    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [      {"CODE":"EMPLOYEEMOTIVATION","NAME":"Employee Motivation Questionnaire",        "TYPE_ID":3,          "_TfQuestions": [{            "Code":"01EMSATISPSRATEDAYS",              "Name":"On a scale of 1 to 7 how satisfied are you with the number and quality time spent on your tasks? (e.g., team meetings or solo work)",                "Type_ID":3,                    "_TFAnswers": [ {            "ANSWER":"I am extremely happy"              },          ]        }]
```

 Explanation: Below you will find an example JSON object that represents a feedback mechanisms thematic questionnaire, with all its different parts and properties described above included in it according to your specifications for the topic 'Feedback Mechanism'. The code of this particular survey is set as "FM_Q1", but can be changed.
Questions are displayed using engaging syntax variations: some questions have a list format where each item has an associated ID, and others use simple radio buttons or checkboxes to select one answer from multiple options available for the same question; there's also placeholders left in certain parts of this survey so that you can fill them with your own content.
Please note all properties are set as strings except 'TYPE_ID', which is an integer, and display order numbers too: they should be integers if used separately from here to maintain the same structure; but for now everything else remains a string in case it needs some adjustment or customization before using this questionnaire.

Generate me a questionnaire on Feedback Mechanisms

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: 
The structure I will use for this feedback mechanisms questionnaire is as follows:
- The 'data' property contains an object with one element, which represents our survey and its questions; the name of that key does not matter. In my JSON representation below it’s called "feedbackQuestionnaires". This way you can easily replace me in a system if needed by changing this single reference to another valid identifier or even import/export functionality!
- The 'TYPE_ID' is always 3, as we are using the same type of question throughout. I have also used TYPE ID = 2 for some questions and it worked well too; you can choose any number between one and seven if needed but remember that different numbers may represent slightly or entirely distinct concepts!
- The '_TF_ANSWERS' array contains an object with a single property 'answers', which is also another valid identifier. In this case, I am using the name "feedbackAnswers" to keep things organized and easy for you as well; it’s always good practice when creating something like me so that others can understand what they are looking at easily!
- The 'DISPLAY_ORDER' is used consistently across all questions. This ensures a consistent order of presentation, which helps users feel comfortable with the interface or system being presented to them and makes your life easier as well by reducing confusion about how things should be displayed in different situations based on user preferences alone; this number could range from 1-n where n equals total count but keep it simple if possible because sometimes people don’t like scrolling through long lists of items!
I have used the following codes and names for each question: 'CODE' = unique code, ‘NAME’=title/name. Questions are presented in order below with their types specified as well; note that some questions may not be appropriate depending on context or audience but feel free to modify any part if necessary before using me!

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you will find an example JSON object that represents a feedback mechanisms thematic questionnaire, which can be used in human resource management field to evaluate and improve certain processes or products based on the received answers from employees or stakeholders. The structure of this specific questionnaire is as follows:
{ "data": { 	"TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [  	{"CODE":"FEEDBACK01",    "NAME": "[Feedback Mechanisms] - Importance and Effectiveness Questionnaire for Internal Processes in HRM Field ",     "TYPE_ID":3,      "_Tf\_ANSWERS":[        {"ANSWER":"Very important"},        	{"ANSWER":"Effective"}       ],    _"TF_QUESTIONS"*:* [
{ 	            *"CODE”:“FEEDBACKEVALUATION01”,   "NAME":"To what extent do you agree that internal feedback mechanisms are crucial for effective evaluation of employees?",     “TYPE\_ID":5,      "_Tf_ANSWERS":[        {"ANSWER":"Strongly Agree"},        	{"ANSWER":"Agree"}       ],    "DISPLAY ORDER”:1   },
{ 	            *"CODE"*:*“FEEDBACKEVALUATION02”,     “NAME”*:*"To what extent do you agree that internal feedback mechanisms are effective in identifying areas for improvement?",      “TYPE\_ID":5,       "_Tf_ANSWERS"*:*{        "ANSWER":"Strongly Agree"},         {" AN SW ER“:< /div>Agree"}
],   	            *"DISPLAY ORDER”* :2   },     { 	            "*CODE*"*:* “FEEDBACKEFFECTIVENESS01”,      "NAME":">=5. How effective do you find internal feedback mechanisms in improving communication between departments?",      
"TYPE\_ID":3,        "_Tf_ANSWERS”:< /div>[          {" AN SW ER“*:* < div>"Very Effective"},        	{" AN S W E R ":*:"Effectiv e"}      ],    “DISPLAY ORDER ” : 1   },     {
```javascript
        "*CODE*"":""FEEDBACKEFFECTIVENESS02"",       "NAME":"How effective do you find internal feedback mechanisms in creating a learning environment? ",        	“TYPE_ID”:3,      "_Tf_ANSWERS"*:*{          “ AN S W E R ":< /div>Very Effective"},
```
1. 	{"CODE": "FEEDBACKEFFECTIVENESS02",
            "NAME":"How effective do you find internal feedback mechanisms in creating a learning environment? ",         <span style="font-family: Arial, sans;">"TYPE\_ID":3</sp>nlineCode&quot;;      "_Tf_ANSWERS”*:*{          &lt;&gt;" AN S W E R ":< /div>< div>"Very Effective"},
```vbnet
        {"CODE":"FEEDBACKEFFECTIVENESS03",    "NAME":">=5. How effective do you find internal feedback mechanisms in improving the overall performance of your organization? ",        	“TYPE_ID”:  <span style="font-family : Arial, sans; >
```
"Very Effective"},          {" AN SW E R ":< /div>< div>"Effectiv e"}      ],    "DISPLAY ORDER ”  3 } ] }; </s>The questionnaire has three questions that ask participants to rate the importance and effectiveness of internal feedback mechanisms in different areas. The first two are about evaluation, communication between departments, identifying improvement opportunities for employees or teams (TYPE\_ID 5), while third one is more general - improving overall performance by using effective methods with a code FEEDBACKEFFECTIVENESS03 and display order of question three to keep the same structure.

Generate me a questionnaire on Internal Mobility Opportunities

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below, you can find an example JSON object that represents a survey for internal mobility opportunities with different types and properties of each element in it to make sure all necessary information is included as requested beforehand but still easy-to-understand. The questionnaire's code here would be 'INTERNAL_MOBILITY', name - Internal Mobility Opportunities, typeId: 3 (rating).
Survey structure and example questions for internal mobility opportunities in JSON format are below with a total of five elements under '_TF\_QUESTIONS'. Each question has the following properties as requested. The admitted types here would be IDs from '1' to '7', but I have used only three different ones (ratings) just like any other type could also work:
```json
{ "data": {    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [        {"CODE":"INTERNAL_MOBILITY",            "NAME": "Internal Mobility Opportunities Survey - Rating Scale of 1-5 (with a comment for each)",                     "TYPE_ID":3,
                "_TfQuestions":[ {            	"code":"Q01",             	    "name":"Number and variety of internal mobility opportunities in the company? ",            “typeId”:2,         	      "displayOrder":549678,                     "__TF_ANSWERS__": [
                {"answerCode":null,"textValue":"1 - Not enough options or not satisfied with what is available","scoreCountedAsPassingScore":false},{"answerCode":2,”    textValue”:“2 – Just a few more opportunities would be nice, but overall happy. ”,                     "scoreCountedAsPassingScore" : true },
                {"answerCode":"3",           	        “textValue”:"3 - Satisfied with the internal mobility options available in my company.",             	    } ]}, {            	“code":       Q02”,         	   "name":"How satisfied are you overall about your current role and its potential for growth? ",                ”typeId" :1,            “displayOrder”:549678,”                     "__TF_ANSWERS__": [

{"answerCode":null,"textValue":"1 - Not at all satisfied","scoreCountedAsPassingScore":false}, {"answerCode":"2", "text Value" :“ 2 – Somewhat content, but not completely happy. ", “ score Count ed As Pass ing Score”: false }, {
```
    } ]} ,{            	   code:"Q03”,         	     name":"How would you rate the company's efforts to provide equal opportunities for internal mobility?",                  "typeId" :1,            “displayOrder":549678,”               __TF_ANSWERS__: [

{"answerCode":"1","textValue":"Not enough effort is made by my employer in providing equitable chances to move within the company. ",              scoreCountedAsPassingScore" : false },                     {"answer Code":2," text Value”:"  The efforts are not perfect, but I see some progress being done.",               "score Count ed As Pass ing Score ": true }
```
]}, {            	   code:       Q04”,          name":"How do you feel about the company's policies regarding internal mobility?",                    “typeId" :1,”            displayOrder":549678,                __TF_ANSWERS__:" + "answerCode”
```
  2","textValue“: 'I am satisfied with my employer’s approach to the matter of moving people internally. ',                     “score Count ed As Pass ing Score" : true } ]} , {            	    code":"Q05",              name":'How would you rate your chances for internal mobility in this company?',            "typeId”:2,          displayOrder“:" + 61978,"__TF_ANSWERS__
```
  3","textValue" : 'I am satisfied with my current role and its potential to move within the organization. ',               scoreCountedAsPassingScore": true } ]]}}}`
Please note that this JSON object is just an example, but it should give a good idea about how such questionnaires could be structured for internal mobility opportunities or any other topic with different types of questions and answers to choose from as requested.

Generate me a questionnaire on Internal Mobility Opportunities

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below, you can find an example JSON object that represents a questionnaire for internal mobility opportunities in human resources management with different types of questions and answers to ensure user engagement throughout the survey process; please note this is just one possible version. The root property 'data' contains only two properties - namely ‘CODE’ (string) which could be used as an identifier, such that it might not change over time or use a timestamp for example in milliseconds since epoch and another single-element array called ’TF_QUESTIONNAIRES’.
The TF\_ QUESTIONNAIRE object has the following properties: CODE (string) - The questionnaire’s code. NAME(String)- Questionnaires name TYPE ID, which is equal to 3 for this example as we are using a rating system in our questions and answers DISPLAY ORDER INT- To order display of survey on page ANSWER Limit Int – Maximum number that can be selected by user before submitting the form.
_TF\_QUESTIONS array, which contains objects representing each question; for this example we have 5 different types: - ID (int) The type identifier such as single select or multiple-choice etc., and DESCRIPTION(String)- A short description of that particular questions format to ensure user engagement.
_TF\_ANSWERS array, which contains objects representing each possible answer; for this example we have 5 different types: - ID (int) The type identifier such as single select or multiple-choice etc., and DESCRIPTION(String)- A short description of that particular questions format to ensure user engagement.
Please find the JSON object below, which can be used directly in your application with some minor adjustments if needed; I have tried my best to make it engaging for users: { "data":{ 	"TF_QUESTIONNAIRES” : [    {"CODE":"INTERNAL\_MOBILITY",
“NAME “:"Internal Mobility Opportunities Questionnaire”,   TYPE ID ":3,     DISPLAY ORDER ”102564789“,      ANSWER LIMIT " 5 ", _TF_QUESTIONS” : [        {"CODE": "INTERNAL\_MOBILITY-FIRST",
"NAME":"How would you rate your current company's internal mobility opportunities? Please select five options that best represent the situation.",   TYPE ID ":3,    DISPLAY ORDER ”1“, _TF_ANSWERS” : [            {"ID": 50,"DESCRIPTION ":"Very Good"},

Generate me a questionnaire on Job Satisfaction

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: 
Below you can find an example JSON object that represents a job satisfaction survey with ten different closed-ended and open- ended questions, using various types of answers to increase user engagement while ensuring the necessary information is gathered. The code for each question has been omitted as it's not essential but could be used in practice if needed:
```json
{  "data": {    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [      {        "CODE":"JS01",          "NAME":"Job Satisfaction - General Statement about Job (Closed-Ended)",          "TYPE_ID":3,        	"DISPLAY_ORDER":256,          
            "_TF_ANSWERS":[             {"ANSWER":"Strongly Agree"},             {"ANSWER":"Agree"}                    ]        },       {      ...  }     ],   "NAME":"Job Satisfaction Survey",        	"TYPE_ID":3          } 
}
```
Questionnaire: JS01 - Job satisfaction survey with ten questions. The first question is a closed-ended type, and the rest are open- ended to gather more detailed information about job satisfaction while increasing user engagement through varied syntaxes of each prompt text for every individual item in this list (open format). This will allow us not only collect data on how satisfied employees feel but also their reasons behind that level.
```json

Generate me a questionnaire on Leadership Effectiveness

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you will find an example JSON object that represents a 'LeaderShip Effectivenes' Questionnaire, which is made up of 10 questions and their respective answers (possible options to choose from). Each answer has the property ANSWER with its content. The question type for all these questions in this sample set-up will be ID:3 - meaning that respondents are asked to rate something on a scale between, let's say one star being least effective and five stars most effective (or any other rating system).
Please note the 'CODE', NAME','TYPE_ID' properties of each question as well. They can help you identify questions in your results if needed for further analysis or reporting purposes:
```json
{  "data": {    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [      {        CODE: “LDRSHPEFFECT1”,          NAME: 'Leadership Effectiveness Questionnaire',         TYPE_ID:3,            _TF_ANSWERS: [{              ANSWER:"Strongly agree"           },             ...                ],
```
Here is the JSON object with a more complete version of this questionnire. I have used stars for rating scale and added some comments to help you understand how it works better, but please remove them if needed:<json> { "data":{ "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":[  {"CODE":"LDRSHPEFFECT1",
``` json NAME:"Leadership Effectiveness Questionnaire - Part I (Self)", TYPE\_ID :3 ,   _TF\_ANSWERS : [    ...          {            ANSWER:"<strong>5</strong><span style="font-weight:normal"> stars"  }        ],
```
}, {"CODE":"LDRSHPEFFECT2", NAME:"Leadership Effectiveness Questionnaire - Part II (Team)", TYPE_ID :3 , _TF\_ANSWERS :`[    ...          {            ANSWER:"<strong>5</strong><span style="font-weight:normal"> stars"  }        ],
``` json }, {"CODE":"LDRSHPEFFECT10", NAME:"Leadership Effectiveness Questionnaire - Part X (General)", TYPE_ID :3 , _TF\_ANSWERS :`[    ...          {            ANSWER:"<strong>5</strong><span style="font-weight:normal"> stars"  }        ],
``` json ]}}}</json>Please note that the above JSON object is just an example and there can be many different ways to structure a questionnaire. I have used this format as it allows for easy rating of each statement, but you may need or want something else in your specific case!

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below I have formatted a JSON object that represents a Questionnaire for "Recognition &amp; Rewards". The questions are designed to gather information from employees about their preferences regarding recognition, rewards programs, or other methods used by the company. This questionnaire can help an organization understand how well its current program is working and what improvements could be made based on employee feedback.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you will find an example JSON object that represents a structured 'Recognition &amp; Rewards' Questionnaire, which is designed to collect data from employees about their preferences regarding recognition types (monetary or non- monetary) as well as the frequency and occasion of rewards.
The question set includes 7 questions with different syntaxes in order to increase user engagement: a mix between multiple choice type answers for easy selection but also text based open ended answer options, that allows employees express their thoughts freely about what they consider important when it comes down recognition &amp; Rewards and how often do we need them.
The questionnaire is structured as follows : 1 root object containing one property 'data' which contains another single element called "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES" that represents the actual Questionnaires array, each item in this Array has a code , name type id etc . The questions are also represented with codes and names to allow easy selection.

 Explanation: Below you will find an example JSON object that represents a work-life balance employee survey with 10 related statements, each asking for agreement or disagreement using type ID=3 questions (ratings). The 'DISPLAY_ORDER' property has been used to order the questionnaire in what is considered logical progression.

Generate me a questionnaire on Workload Management

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below, you can find an example JSON object that represents a structured Questionnaire for 'Workload Management'. The root property is named ‘data’ and contains only one element with key called ’TF\_QUESTIONNAIRES’, which in turn includes the questionnaire. This structure has three main properties – CODE (unique code), NAME, TYPE_ID - as well as an array of questions (_TF\_QUESTIONS). Each item within this _TF\_ QUESTIONS list is also a structured object with its own set of four parameters: 
- ‘CODE’ for the question's unique identifier. This can be used to reference and link related items together, such as answers or participants;  
 - 'NAME': The actual text content/question itself that will appear in frontend interface (either on paper form OR digital);   
 - TYPE\_ID: A number indicating type of question it is – for example if the answer should be a single value from predefined list, multiple values or something else; and  
- 'DISPLAY_ORDER': An integer that defines order in which questions will appear. This can help ensure logical flow within survey by placing more important/relevant topics first while less critical ones come later on – this also makes it easier for participants to follow along without feeling overwhelmed at start of process!   
In the example below, I have included six different types with their own specific characteristics and purposes:  
- ID 1 (Single Choice) is useful when there's a limited set of options available but only one should be selected;    
 - ID2(Multiple choice): Allows multiple selections from predefined list if desired. This type could help gather more detailed information about participants’ preferences and opinions without forcing them into binary choices between two extremes!   
-ID 3 (Rating Scale) is perfect for rating something on scale of values, often used when measuring satisfaction or other subjective experiences;    
 - ID4(Text Field): Used to acquire feedback in form free text. This type can be especially useful if there's no predefined set options and more open-ended approach desired!   
–ID 5 (Reordering Questions) is ideal for reorganizing items according specific criteria, allowing participants prioritize things based on importance or relevance;    
 - ID6(Distribution of Weights): Suitable when distributing weights across several different options/answers. This type can help identify relative significance placed upon various elements within system!   
-ID 7 (Question Cloning) is used to clone questions from template, providing consistent structure and format throughout survey while still maintaining flexibility needed for certain types of items;    
 - ID8(Date or Date/Time): Used when the answer should be a date value. This type can help establish timeframes around which events occur!   
Please note that I have tried to keep syntax varied enough so as not bore users, but also kept it simple and easy-to understand for all types of audiences – including those who may struggle with more complex interfaces due lack experience or familiarity using digital tools.  
Here is the JSON object:     {        "data":{            "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":[                {"CODE":"WORKLOAD\_MANAGEMENT","NAME":"Workload Management Questionnaire",            	"TYPE_ID":3,                    “DISPLAYORDER” :10,” _TF_ QUESTIONS ”: [
```python     {            "CODE": "Q1A",                "NAME": "<strong>Question:</strong><br/><span style='font-size:25px'>How do you feel about your current workload?</SPAN>",                   	"TYPE_ID":3,

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below, you will find an example JSON object that represents a structured workplace culture survey with 10 engaging multiple-choice and rating scale type questions to help assess various aspects of organizational climate in order for employees' needs and concerns be better understood. The questionnaire consists mainly from three types - single select (ID=1), multi-select(ID=2) &amp; Rating Scale IDs 3,4).
Questions are arranged based on display_order to maintain a logical flow of topics: starting with general work environment and then moving towards more specific aspects. The questionnaire is designed in such way that it can be easily understood by any user regardless their background or position within the company as all questions have clear instructions about what information they aim at collecting, which should increase response rate significantly if distributed among employees via email for instance with an explanation of its importance and purpose stated clearly so people feel encouraged to participate.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below, you can find an example JSON object that represents a structured workplace environment-related questionnaire with 5 multiple choice and one rating type questions in its 'questions' array property (which is nested inside the '_TF_QUESTIONS' element). The code of each item has been generated randomly.
Please note, this structure can be adjusted to fit any specific requirements you may have:
```json
{    "data": {        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [            {                "CODE":"WKPLC01",                   "NAME":"Workplace Environment - General Questions I"             },              ...5 more questionnaire objects could be added here...          ]       }    
}    and each of the above 'data' object questions array would look like this:         "_TF_QUESTIONS": [            {                "CODE": "<unique code for a specific item>",                   "NAME":"<name or title, e.g., question number one - do not forget to sanitize!>",                   
"TYPE_ID": <one of the types mentioned above>,             
             "_TF_ANSWERS": [            {                "<unique code for an answer option>","ANSWER":"<the content or text value>"           },          ...more answers could be added here...        ]       }    ],      "DISPLAY_ORDER": <display order, e.g., integer number>",             
"TYPE_ID":3,"NAME":"What is the overall cleanliness of your workplace?","ANSWER10-POINTSCALE": {                "-25% to -1%<br>Very poor",                   "1-% <br>Poor",            "+9.876% ...
