        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.

        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you will find an example JSON object that represents one potential benefits-related employee satisfaction survey with 10 specific and targeted multiple choice (single answer) questions, each designed to elicit information about the respondent's level of appreciation for certain types or aspects related directly AND indirectly WITHIN a company.
The questionnaire is structured as follows: 'data': {	'_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES’ : [  {    ‘CODE‘   = ’BENEFITS1’,     NAME      :=>'Employee Satisfaction with Healthcare Benefits',        TYPE\_ID       =>3,          '_ TF \_\_ANSWERS':[         {            ANSwER: 'Excellent healthcare benefits are a major factor in my job satisfaction.',                CODE   : ’H1‘ },           {             AnswEr:'I feel that our company cares about the health of its employees.' ,              Code    ='h2'},         	...],         '_TF\_QUESTIONS':[            {                 'CODE’: ‘BENEFITS_0’,                NAME      :>‘Do you think your employer provides good retirement benefits?',             TYPE ID   =>1,           DISPLAY ORDER    =<3>,         	'_ TF \_\__ANSWERS'     [         {            ANSwER: 'Yes I do.',              CODE       :=’R0_YES‘ },                {                 AnswEr:'No and it is a major concern for me.' ,             Code    = ’ R\_NO ‘},         	...],           ...,        ]   }]

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you can find an example JSON object that represents how this topic-specific career path clarity employee satisfaction survey is structured and formatted according your specifications, with 10 questions in total (5 are about the current job of respondent while other five ask to compare it against a hypothetical 'dream' position).
Each question has its own unique code for easier referencing. Questions use different types - from single or multiple choice up-to rating and reordering items, depending on what is being asked in particular case (either about satisfaction level with current job role/tasks assigned to employee etc., comparison of certain aspects between present position vs dream one).
Questions are displayed according the order they appear below. Questions that ask for a specific answer type have predefined options and use ID 3, while others vary based on what is being asked in particular case (either about satisfaction level with current job role/tasks assigned to employee etc., comparison of certain aspects between present position vs dream one).
Please note: This questionnaire does not contain any questions that would require a date or datetime as an answer. Also, there are no cloning-related options included in this example because it is assumed the respondent will be able provide all necessary information without need for such functionality (however if needed - can easily add).

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below, you can find an example JSON structure for generating 10 specific internal mobility opportunity related interview type and rating based questions with their respective answers in English language to assess the candidate's experience level within company. The order of these displayed is designed as a conversation flow between two people (interviewer-candidate) rather than using technical terms, which makes it more engaging for candidates:
```json
{  "data": {    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES" : [      {"CODE":"INTERNALMOBILITY1",        NAME:"How often have you moved within the company in past two years? (Number of times)",         TYPE\_ID:3,          _ TF \_\_.ANSWERS ":[            {                ANSER:'0'             },              {'

``` Principal type of answer is to rate something (1-5) or select one option out 6, so I used RATING as the main property. If it was not a case and principal question's answers would be an array with all possible options for this questions: { "RADIO": [
```json    {"ANSWER":"Yes"},{" AN SW ER ":   <mark>  }" Yes, I feel that there have been enough internal mobility opportunities in my current organization",                        /* Answer */               "{         },{             ",            /      ,              { "CHECKBOXES": [

```  }]}}}`Elsewhere, I have provided a unique code for each element as it's usually different from one another and can be useful in some cases (for example when cloning or duplicating elements). Also the order of display is important to keep same structure. The questionnaire content should reflect all aspects that are needed by HR managers:
 - How do employees feel about internal mobility opportunities? Is it enough for them, not too much and neither less than desired amount in their current organization (RATING type)? Are they satisfied with the number of open positions or if there is a chance to get promoted internally within an organisation. This can be measured by RADIO buttons where only one answer could fit: Yes / No
 - Is it possible for employees from different departments and teams interact, share ideas about projects that are in progress? Can they work together on the same project or task (CHECKBOXES type)? Or is there a need to reorder items according with their importance level. This can be measured by RATING as well but this time we have more options than only Yes / No
 - Is it possible for employees from different departments and teams interact, share ideas about projects that are in progress? Can they work together on the same project or task (CHECKBOXES type)? Or is there a need to distribute weights across several items/options. This can be measured by RADIO buttons where only one answer could fit: Yes / No
 - Is it possible for employees from different departments and teams interact, share ideas about projects that are in progress? Can they work together on the same project or task (CHECKBOXES type)? Or is there a need to clone questions using DATEPICK_MULTIPLE option where more than one answer could fit: Yes / No

 Explanation: The structure I will use for this 'LeaderShip EffecTiveness' (LET) QuestionnAire is as follows, using JSON format and including 10 questions with their respective answers in the '_TF_ANSWERS’ array. Each question has a unique code ('CODE'), content or name of that particular item ("NAME"), type ID for which it was created (“TYPE\_ID”), display order (DISPLAY ORDER) as well, but also an additional property called 'IS REQUIRED' to indicate whether the answer is mandatory and if yes then its value will be true.

 Explanation: The structure I will follow for creating this 'Leaderhip Effecativenes' Questionnire is as follows - 1) There would be an object named data, which in turn has another array-like property called TF_QUESTIONNAIRES. This second level also contains only one element i.,e the questionnaire itself and it will have several properties like CODE (unique code for this Questionnire), NAME ('Leaderhip Effectiveness'), TYPE\_ID, _TF\_{} QUESITONS etc as described in your prompt 2) In '_ TF_QUESTION' array-like property of the questionnaire object I will generate several objects representing each individual questions. Each such 'question" would have properties like CODE (unique code for this specific Question), NAME, TYPE\_ID and DISPLAY ORDER etc as described in your prompt 3) In '_ TF_ANSWERS' array-like property of the question object I will generate several objects representing each individual answer. Each such 'answer" would have a single proeprty AN SWER (string type).

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you can find an example JSON object that represents my proposed structure for generating 'OnBoarding Questionnaires'. The code, name and display order of each element are just placeholders in this case as they will depend upon the specific details provided by user. I have used different types to make it more engaging but kept syntax simple so users can understand easily:
```json= {    "data":{        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":[            {"CODE":"ONBOARDING1",                NAME:"How would you rate the overall onboarding experience? (Rating)                 ",              TYPE\_ID :3,             _TfAnswers: [

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you can find an example JSON object that represents my structure for creating 'OnBoarding Questionnare'. The root element is named as "data" and it contains only one property called '_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' which in turn has a single questionnaire.
The name of the onboarding experience, its code (either alphanumeric or numeric), type id are defined within this object along with an array for questions that can be used to gather information about employee’s satisfaction and feedback during their first few days at work/company using different types such as ID: 3 which is a rating system.
The questionnaire also includes the display order of each individual item in it, so they appear on screen according plan rather than randomly or out-of -order way making user experience more pleasant while answering them one by One! The questions are carefully crafted to be engaging and easy for users who might not have technical backgrounds.

Generate me a questionnaire on Onboarding Experience

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you can find an example JSON object that represents my structure for creating 'OnBoarding Questionnare'. The root element is named as "data" and it contains only one property called '_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' which in turn has a single questionnaire.
The name of the onboarding experience, its code (either alphanumeric or numeric), type id are defined for this example along with 5 questions that have their own codes and names as well: 'TYPE\_ID', '_TF_ANSWERS' &amp; '# ANSWRs'.
Please note there is no such thing like "DISPLAY ORDER" in my JSON structure. I use a different approach to order the questionnaire elements, but if you need this specific property let me know and will add it: {    'data':{        '_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' : [            {'CODE’:'ONB01',                ’NAME‘:"Onboarding Experience",                 "TYPE\_ID":3,"DISPLAYORDER"
```python   , ...,     "_TfQuestions”:[         {             'Code': ‘QUESTION_ONE’,              “Name“ : ”Please rate your overall on-Boarding experience”,                ’TypeId‘:"1",                 "Answers": [            {"ANSWR":"Excellent"},{" AN SWSR"

Generate me a questionnaire on Recognition and Rewards

-------------------

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you will find an example JSON object that represents one possible recognition-and rewards themed employee satisfaction survey with 10 questions, each of which has five answer options for respondents to choose from (ranging in type IDs between '3' - rating and ‘4’ – feedback).
The questionnaire is structured as follows: a single property called "data" that contains an array named “TF_QUESTIONNAIRES” with one element, which represents the survey. This object has several properties including CODE (unique code for this specific employee satisfaction recognition-and rewards themed), NAME and TYPE\_ID among others to define each question’s type ID in _ TF QUESTlONES array using a display order that makes logical sense while also providing an engaging experience with varied syntax.
```json {    "data":{        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES ":[            {"CODE":"1","NAME”:"How satisfied are you overall, on scale of 0-5 (with five being highest satisfaction)?" ,               “TYPE ID“:3,"DISPLAY ORDER" :2,”
```
Questionnaire Content for Recognition and Rewards Employee Satisfaction Survey with Five Possible Answers per Question in JSON Format.

Generate me a questionnaire on Training and Development Programs

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you can find an example JSON object that represents my proposed training, development programs Questionaire in human resource management field with 5 questions (TYPE_ID =3) for each participant to rate something from scale of one(lowest score)-to-ten.(highest).
Each question has a unique CODE and NAME. The order is as follows: 'data' object, which contains an array called "TF\_QUESTIONNAIRES" with only 1 element representing the whole Questionnaire in JSON format; this specific example includes following properties -CODE (string) for each questions code,-NAME(String)-for-each question name and type ID as integer.
'_TFS_ANSWERS' array contains a single property 'Answer', which is also string, that represents an answer to the corresponding Question with CODE from scale of one-(lowest score),to ten (highest). The admitted types for questions are: 1-ID means participant will choose only option and not able change it.
2 - ID Means Participant can select multiple options or even all, but he/she is unable to deselect any selected answer; this type of question allows participants just add more answers without removing them from selection.-3rd Type (Rating) gives ability for participant rate something with scale 1-to ten.
4th ID means acquiring feedback and not rating or choosing options, but asking open questions about specific topics to get detailed information in text format; this type of question is used when there are no any prerequisite answers needed.-5ID Means that the same Question will be repeated with different participants for better understanding.
Please note: Questions should vary from each other and not repeat, but they can have similar content or use some common words to make them more familiar; this example is just a template of how questions could look like in JSON format using specific types based on my knowledge about the topic-Training & Development Programs for employees.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you can find an example JSON object that represents my proposed structure for generating 'WorkPlaceEnvironment' type-3 (rating) and -5 ('Rate from list') questions in order to collect data about workplace environment satisfaction of employees. The goal is not only get a score but also understand which aspects are important, what should be improved or changed by collecting more detailed information with the help rating scale question types (-2: very dissatisfied;-1:'Dissatisifed'; 0 'Neutral/Can't say', + Needs improvement and action is required).
The JSON object contains a single property called "data" which has an array of only one element, representing the actual survey. The questionnaire consists out from: code (unique identifier), name(title) type_id(_TF\_QUESTIONS - it's either 3 or-5 for this example).
Questions are represented as a list in "_tfQuestion" property and each item has its own properties like CODE, NAME. The answers to the questions can be found under '_TfAnswers'. Each answer is an object with only one string type of 'ANSWER' which represents content for this questionnaire code:
```json  {    "data": [        {"TF_QUESTIONNAIRES" :[           {"CODE":"WORKPLACE1","NAME":"Please rate your overall satisfaction about the workplace environment on a scale from -2 to +3",               "+TYPEID”:"5”,                 "_TfQuestions“: [{              "Code": “OFFICEENVIRONMENTSATISFACTION_QUESTIONNAIRECODE“,           	"Name":"What is your overall satisfaction with the cleanliness of this workplace?","TypeId
