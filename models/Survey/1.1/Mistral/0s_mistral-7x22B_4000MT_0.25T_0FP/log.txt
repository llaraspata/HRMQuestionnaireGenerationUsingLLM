[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation:
The questionnaire is structured as follows:

- The 'data' property of the root object contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
- 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire.
- Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties: 'CODE', 'NAME', 'TYPE_ID', 'DISPLAY_ORDER', and '_TF_ANSWERS'.
- Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER'.

The questionnaire on Access to Technology and Tools is as follows:

{
 "data": {
 "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [
 {
 "CODE": "ACCESSTOTECHNOLOGYANDTOOLS",
 "NAME": "Access to Technology and Tools",
 "TYPE_ID": 3,
 "_TF_QUESTIONS": [
 {
 "CODE": "QUESTION_1",
 "NAME": "What is your current access to technology and tools?",
 "TYPE_ID": 3,
 "DISPLAY_ORDER": 1,
 "_TF_ANSWERS": [
 {
 "ANSWER": "I have good access to technology and tools"
 },
 {
 "ANSWER": "I have limited access to technology and tools"
 },
 {
 "ANSWER": "I do not have access to technology and tools"
 }
 ]
 },
 {
 "CODE": "QUESTION_2",
 "NAME": "How often do you use technology and tools for work?",
 "TYPE_ID": 8,
 "DISPLAY_ORDER": 2,
 "_TF_ANSWERS": [
 {
 "ANSWER": "I use technology and tools for work every day"
 },
 {
 "ANSWER": "I use technology and tools for work a few times a week"
 },
 {
 "ANSWER": "I rarely use technology and tools for work"
 },
 {
 "ANSWER": "I never use technology and tools for work"
 }
 ]
 },
 {
 "CODE": "QUESTION_3",
 "NAME": "What types of technology and tools do you use?",
 "TYPE_ID": 5,
 "DISPLAY_ORDER": 3,
 "_TF_ANSWERS": [
 {
 "ANSWER": "I use a computer and the Internet for work"
 },
 {
 "ANSWER": "I use a smartphone and tablet for work"
 },
 {
 "ANSWER": "I use productivity tools and applications for work"
 }
 ]
 }
 ]
 }
}

The questionnaire consists of three questions. The first question asks about the current access to technology and tools, the second question asks how often technology and tools are used for work, and the third question asks about the types of technology and tools used. The answers to these questions will help to understand the user's access to technology and tools, frequency of use, and types of technology and tools used.

Generate me a questionnaire on Benefits

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation:
This questionnaire is structured as a JSON object with a single property 'data'. The 'data' property contains an array of questionnaires, in this case, only one questionnaire about employee benefits.

{
"data": {
"TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [
{
"CODE": "EMPLOYEE_BENEFITS",
"NAME": "Employee Benefits Questionnaire",
"TYPE_ID": 3,
"_TF_QUESTIONS": [
{
"CODE": "Q01",
"NAME": "Do you offer a 401k plan to your employees?",
"TYPE_ID": 3,
"DISPLAY_ORDER": 1,
"_TF_ANSWERS": [
{
"ANSWER": "Yes"
},
{
"ANSWER": "No"
}
]
},
{
"CODE": "Q02",
"NAME": "Do you offer health insurance benefits to your employees?",
"TYPE_ID": 3,
"DISPLAY_ORDER": 2,
"_TF_ANSWERS": [
{
"ANSWER": "Yes, fully funded"
},
{
"ANSWER": "Yes, but only partially funded"
},
{
"ANSWER": "No"
}
]
},
{
"CODE": "Q03",
"NAME": "Do you offer any wellness programs to your employees?",
"TYPE_ID": 3,
"DISPLAY_ORDER": 3,
"_TF_ANSWERS": [
{
"ANSWER": "Yes, fully funded"
},
{
"ANSWER": "Yes, but only partially funded"
},
{
"ANSWER": "No"
}
]
},
{
"CODE": "Q04",
"NAME": "Do you offer any type of vision or dental insurance?",
"TYPE_ID": 3,
"DISPLAY_ORDER": 4,
"_TF_ANSWERS": [
{
"ANSWER": "Yes, fully funded"
},
{
"ANSWER": "Yes, but only partially funded"
},
{
"ANSWER": "No"
}
]
},
{
"CODE": "Q05",
"NAME": "Do you offer any type of paid family or medical leave?",
"TYPE_ID": 3,
"DISPLAY_ORDER": 5,
"_TF_ANSWERS": [
{
"ANSWER": "Yes, fully funded"
},
{
"ANSWER": "Yes, but only partially funded"
},
{
"ANSWER": "No"
}
}
]
}
}
}

Questions are designed to be simple and easy to understand, while the answers are also short and easy to choose from. The use of "Yes" and "No" answers is simple and easy to understand, but also added the possibility of partially funded benefits. This way, the questionnaire can be used to gather information about the benefits offered by a company and the level of funding for those benefits.

The questionnaire is structured as a JSON object with a single property 'data'. The 'data' property contains an array of questionnaires, and each questionnaire has a unique 'CODE', 'NAME', and 'TYPE_ID'. The questionnaire also has an array of questions, and each question has a 'CODE', 'NAME', 'TYPE_ID', 'DISPLAY_ORDER', and an array of possible answers.

              {
                "ANSWER": "I prefer to give feedback in person, during a one-on-one meeting."

          },
          {
            "CODE": "Q2",
            "NAME": "What do you think about the importance of feedback?",

              },
              {
                "ANSWER": "I don't think feedback is that important and prefer to give it only when necessary."
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The questionnaire has two questions, and each question has four possible answers. The answers are designed to capture a range of opinions about feedback mechanisms, and the use of open-ended questions encourages more thoughtful responses. The first question asks how feedback is usually given, and the second question asks about the importance of feedback.
