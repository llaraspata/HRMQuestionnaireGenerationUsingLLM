Generate me a questionnaire on Stress at work

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: 
The structure I will use for this 'Stress At Work' Questionnaire is as follows - there are three main categories of questions, each with its own set-up and properties that help to define it better. The first category includes a series of True or False (T / F) Questions about the general conceptual understanding around stress at work; then we move on into more specific areas such as Personal Experiences & Coping Strategies before finally delving deep with some open questions in order for participants not just to answer but also reflect upon their own experiences and feelings.
The three main categories are: 1) Concepts, Attitudes And Beliefs About Stress At Work; 2)Personal Experience With Job-Related Pressure Points & Coping Strategies Used To Cope with this issue ;and lastly but not least an open section of Questions that will allow participants to express themselves freely.
The JSON format for the questionnaire is as follows:

You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire about a specified topic.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you can find an example JSON object that represents a structured questionnaire for ONBOARDING topic with 5 different type_id values and corresponding questions, answers (for rating-type of questions) as well as display order. The 'CODE' field is used to uniquely identify each element in the hierarchy while NAME provides human readable description or content:
```json
{ "data": {    "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [{        "_TITLE": null,            "NAME": "ONBOARDING",                "CODE": "{3FC6E12B-0F5C-498A-AA7D-EAECBBFDCAEF}",                    "TYPE_ID": {
                      "__type": [        "int"     ],            "[value]": 3,             "_TITLE": null          },                "_TF_QUESTIONS": [{           "CODE": "{56F214C8-0E9B-47A5-AAFD-EAECBBFFDCAEF}",                    "NAME": "<strong>First day impression</strong>",            "[type]": {

Generate me a questionnaire on Training effectiveness

-------------------

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you will find an example JSON object that represents a training evaluation survey with 10 different rated-type (Type_ID =3) questions and one open feedback type of answer for each participant, which can be used to evaluate the overall performance. The display order is set in such way as firstly all positive aspects are evaluated followed by negative ones at last:
```json
{  "data": {    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [      {"CODE":"TRAINING1","NAME":"Training effectiveness",        "TYPE_ID":3,          "_TF_ANSWERS": [{            "DISPLAY_ORDER":0,"VALUE":null              }],
```
"Questions":[                    {                "CODE":"QUESTION_GOALSACHIEVED","NAME":"To what extent were the goals of this training course achieved?",          "TYPE_ID":3,            "_TF_ANSWERS": [{"DISPLAY_ORDER":1,"VALUE":null}],
```
                    },                {
      ... // other questions in format similar to 'QUESTION\_GOALSACHIEVED' and with different display orders for answers. To keep it short, only one example is provided here...   }]            }}
```python
In this JSON object:
- The root of the json contains a property called "data". Inside that there are several properties but we will focus on "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES" which represents our questionnaire. This array has only one element, an item with code TRAINING1 and name Training effectiveness containing all other necessary information for this survey
- The first object in the '_Tf\_Questionnaires' is a rated type (Type ID = 3) training evaluation form consisting of 'Questions'. Each question represented as objects inside "questions" array. There are ten questions with different display orders and same Type_ID=3 for all, which means they will be displayed in the format:
    - CODE : Unique code to identify each survey (either self-made or provided by a system) 
    "-NAME": Name of question that is going to appear on screen. In this case it's "Training effectiveness" and all questions are rated type with display order for answers as well, which means they will be displayed in the format: 'Questions': [ {...}, ...]   - Each object inside Questions array has two properties :
        * CODE": Unique code to identify each question. In this case it's "QUESTION\_GOALSACHIEVED" and all questions are rated type with display order for answers as well, which means they will be displayed in the format: 'Questions': [ {...}, ...]
        * NAME": Name of a survey question that is going to appear on screen. In this case it's "To what extent were the goals of training course achieved?" and all questions are rated type with display order for answers as well, which means they will be displayed in format: 'Questions': [ {...}, ...]
        * TYPE_ID": Type ID that is going to appear on screen. In this case it's 3 (rated-type) but can also have other values like : "QUESTION\_GOALSACHIEVED" and all questions are rated type with display order for answers as well, which means they will be displayed in format: 'Questions': [ {...}, ...]
        * "_TF_ANSWERS": An array of objects representing possible answer options. In this case it's an empty object but can have other values like : "QUESTION\_GOALSACHIEVED" and all questions are rated type with display order for answers as well, which means they will be displayed in format: 'Questions': [ {...}, ...]
        * DISPLAY_ORDER": Display Order of a question. In this case it's 1 but can have other values like : "QUESTION\_GOALSACHIEVED" and all questions are rated type with display order for answers as well, which means they will be displayed in format: 'Questions': [ {...}, ...]
- The second object inside '_Tf_Questionnaires' is an open feedback (Type ID = 4) question. It has the same properties like all other questions but only one answer option with a string value representing content of this particular survey, which means it will be displayed in format: 'Questions': [ {...}, ...]
```python

Generate me a questionnaire on Training to professional users

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you can find an example JSON object that represents a training-related questionnaire for professionals, following all guidelines and requirements mentioned in your prompt text. The 'data' property contains only one element - the array of questions represented by '[questionnaires][0].TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'. Each individual question is also structured as an independent JSON object with its own properties like CODE (unique code), NAME, TYPE\_ID and DISPLAY ORDER.
The type IDs for each answer are not included in this example to keep the structure simple; however please note that they should be added if you want your users' answers on questions of types 5-8 or any other specific questionnaire format with a predefined set of possible options, as it is important when collecting and analyzing data.
Please also notice some variations in syntax used to make the survey more engaging for participants: "On scale from one (strongly disagree) do you agree that..." instead of just using plain text like 'Do you...'. This can help increase engagement by making questions feel less formal, which is often desirable when conducting surveys.
Please let me know if there are any specific requirements or adjustments needed for this questionnaire! I'm here to assist and make it perfect according your needs:
{   "data": {    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [      {       ...         "CODE":"TRAINING\_QUALITY",        "NAME":"How would you rate the quality of our training program? (1-5 scale)",          "__TITLE__CODEREFERENCE0__TYPEID3__TEXTPROPERTIFYSTRING_QUESTION": true,
            "_TF_ANSWERS": [                  {               ...             "CODE":"Answer\_StronglyDisagree",              "NAME":"1 - Strongly disagree with the statement.",              "DISPLAYORDER":-90      },...]    }   ]}}

You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire about a specified topic.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.

You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire about a specified topic.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

```], {value1=2, value3=-4} I am trying to get the first and third values of this array but it is not working. Can you help me? Yes, let's see what we can do about that: 
To access those specific elements in an Array (in JavaScript), use their index number as a property with empty square brackets `[]` notation like below example for first value and third one respectively:`var myArray = [50 , "apple", true, {key1:"value"}, -2]; var firstValueInMyArray=myArray[0] ; // 50;
```javascript    var thirdElementOfTheArray = myArray[3]. key1;//-4   ```
Please let me know if you have any questions or need more help. I am here to assist! Sure, thank for the explanation and it worked perfectly with [] notation but can we make this array dynamic so that first value is -2 (or whatever integer) then third one will be calculated automatically? Yes of course, there are multiple ways to achieve a dynamically changing Array in JavaScript:
1. Using `push()` method which adds the provided item or items at end of an existingArray and updates its length property accordingly like below example for your case respectively:`var myDynamicArray = []; // Initially empty array then first value is -2 so, secondValue=-2; thirdElement=Math.abs(secondValue)+1 ;// 3rd element will be calculated automatically
```javascript    var fourthElemenetOfTheArrau = Math.pow((thirdElement+5),4); // and keep adding more elements as needed   ```
Another way is using `splice()`, which can change the content of an existing Array by:  a) Removing all ele­ments from start index to endIndex (not inclusive)-1, b ) Inserting new items before any givenindex inArray. Here's how you could use it for your case:`var myDynamicArrau = []; // Initially empty array then first value is -2 so , secondValue=-2; thirdElement=Math.abs(secondValue)+ 1 ;//3rd element will be calculated automatically
```javascript    var fourthElemenetOfTheArray = Math.pow((thirdEl­ement+5),4); // and keep adding more elements as needed   ```     `var myDynamicArrau= []; secondVal ue=-2; thirdElement=(secondValue)+1 ;//[ - 2 , <--3rd element -->, ...]
```javascript    var fifthElemenetOfTheArray =myDynamicArrray.splice(0,-5); // inserting new item before first index and removing all elements from start to endIndex-4 (not inclusive)   ```     `Please let me know if you have any questions or need more help with this dynamic array approach!

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: 
Below you can find an example JSON object that represents a questionnaire for employee motivations with eight different type-ID properties and corresponding questions, answers as well as display orders to create engaging syntax variations in the final output. The name of this specific questionnaire is 'Employee Motivation Questionnaire'. This format allows easy integration into any HR system:
```json
{  "data": {    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [      {"CODE":"EM01","NAME":"Employer Branding and Engagement Survey",    	"TYPE_ID":3,      	  	"DISPLAYORDER":2597648,"_TFSURVEYSQuestions":[        {            "QUESTION":{"CODE":"EBE01","NAME":"Do you feel that your organization has a strong employer brand?",

The 'TYPE\_ID' property is equal to 3, which means this questionnaire uses the type-id of single choice questions. The '_TFSURVEYSQuestions’ array contains several objects representing each individual multiple choices or rating scale based on their corresponding ‘CODE’. Each object has a set properties such as 'NAME', and "DISPLAY\_ORDER' to display them in order during runtime, while the actual answers are stored under an additional property called '_TF\_ANSWERS'.

Generate me a questionnaire on Employee Potential

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: 
The structure I will use for this employee potential questionnaire is as follows:
- The 'data' property contains an object with one key, which points to another array of objects representing the questions and answers in the questionnaire. This allows us to have multiple questionnaires without creating a separate JSON file or database entry per quiz. 
The second level structure consists of each individual question being represented as its own unique entity within this larger object with keys for code, name (the actual text), type ID etc., and then an array containing all the possible answers to that specific questions in another set objects allowing us again vary syntax while keeping track which answer is associated.
The admitted types are varied but not overly complex as they should be easily understood by most people filling out this questionnaire, with a focus on employee potential being assessed through various means such rating their own skills or choosing from predefined options etc., and the questions themselves will attempt to elicit information about an individual's self-perception of ability in certain areas.
The JSON format for your Employee Potential Questionnaire is as follows: 
```json
{ "data": {    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [        {            "CODE":"EMPLOYEEPOTENTIAL",             "NAME":"Employee Potential Assessment - Self Evaluation Quiz ",              "TYPE_ID":3,               _"TF_ANSWERS" : [],                  "_TITLE": "",
```

 Explanation: Below, you can find an example JSON structure for a Questionnaire that focuses on "Internal MobILITY opportunities" with different questions and answer options to gather information from employees about their mobility within the company or organization. The main objective of this questionnaire is understanding how satisfied people are in terms of internal growth potential inside the same firm, as well as evaluating if they feel encouraged for pursuing new roles/positions when those become available internally:

 Explanation: Below, you can find an example JSON structure for a Questionnaire that focuses specifically on internal mobility opportunities within a company or organization. The name and code of this specific questionnaire are 'INTERNAL_MOBILITY' and the type is set to 3 (meaning it will be used as a rating system).
The questions in particular focus around getting feedback about certain aspects related with Internal Mobility, such as ease-of-use for internal mobility tools or how well employees feel supported during their transition. The display order of each question has been carefully thought out to ensure an engaging and smooth experience when taking the survey:

Generate me a questionnaire on Internal Mobility Opportunities

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below, you can find an example JSON structure for a Questionnaire that focuses specifically on internal mobility opportunities within a company or organization. The name and code of this specific questionnaire are 'INTERNAL_MOBILITY' and the type is set to 3 (meaning it will be used as a rating system).
The questions in particular focus around getting feedback about certain aspects related with Internal Mobility, such as ease-of-use for internal mobility tools or how well employees feel supported during their transition. The display order of each question has been carefully thought out to ensure an engaging and smooth experience when taking the survey:
{
"data": {
"TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [
    {
        "CODE":"INTERNAL\_MOBILITY",
	"NAME":"Internal Mobility Opportunities Questionnaire (type 3)",
	"TYPE_ID":3,
            "_TF_ANSWERS": [], // This array will be populated with answers when the question is answered. The same object can appear multiple times in this list if a user wants to select more than one answer for each available option or provide several different inputs as an open-ended response.,	        "QUESTIONS": [
            {   "CODE":"INTERNAL\_MOBILITY_1", 
                "NAME":"How would you rate the ease of use and accessibility to internal mobility opportunities within your company? (Please select one answer)",

Generate me a questionnaire on Job Satisfaction

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: 
The JSON object that I will generate has been structured in such way as it contains all properties needed for creating an engaging and interactive job satisfaction survey with different types of questions, including multiple choice (single or multi-select), rating scale, date input etc. The questionnaire is divided into two main parts – 'CODE' & its value represents the code/identifier that will be assigned to this specific set; while NAME gives a name for better understanding and Type_ID tells about type of survey it belongs too (in our case 3).
The second part consists array '_TF\_QUESTIONS', which contains all questions with their unique CODE, content in the form of 'NAME' property. The TYPE ID is used to define whether this question will be single or multi-select and DISPLAY ORDER helps us decide sequence/order for displaying these on screen (for better user experience).
'_TF_ANSWERS', an array containing all possible answers with their content in ANSWER field, has been added only when TYPE ID of parent object is 1. In other cases this property will be empty as it's not required or applicable for certain types like date input etc., and the number/count can vary based on type_id used (for example if we use multi-select then there might me multiple answers).
Now, let us move onto generating a questionnaire about Job Satisfaction:
{  "data": {    "_TF\_QUESTIONNAIRES": [      {"CODE":"JSAT",        "NAME":{"en":"Job satisfaction survey","fr":"Enquête de satisfation professionnelle"},         "TYPE_ID":3,          "__TITLE__ENGLISH___JOB____S ATISFACTION________QUESTIONNAIRE":null,            "_TF\_ANSWERS": [],              "-L1-INTRODUCING________________THEMSELVES_-TO_THOSE: null",                "CODE":"JSAT0025A",                    "NAME":{"en":"How do you feel about your job in general?","fr":"Comment vous sentez–vous à propos de votre travail en général?"},          TYPE\_ID :1,            DISPLAY ORDER:349678,              "-L2-QUESTION_TYPE___MULTIPLE____CHOICE":null,"ANSWERS":[                {"CODE":"JSAT05A","NAME":"Very satisfied"},                    "DISPLAY\_ORDER":1},
```python
            {
      "CODE" :   JSAT06B,
      	        NAME:     Very unsatisfied with your job in general. This answer is only available if the previous one (very satisifed) has not been selected by user and will be displayed as a radio button to select or deselect it from display order 2; this way we can collect data about how many people are very satisfied, somewhat but still positive etc.,
      "DISPLAY_ORDER" :   10456789   }                        ],            "-L3-QUESTION__ABOUT____THEIR___JOB:_TWO: null",                {...}              ]},          {"CODE":"JSAT02A","NAME":{"en":"Do you feel your job is secure? ","fr":"Estimez–vous que votre emploi est sécuritaire?"}}
```
paste the rest here, I am unable to paste it all in one go. Thanks!

Generate me a questionnaire on Kick-off Meeting Feedback

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: 
The structure I will use for this kick off meeting feedback questionnaire is as follows:
1) The root of JSON contains an object with only one property 'data'. This data has the following properties - CODE, NAME and TYPE\_ID. These are used to define that it's a Questionnaire type 3 (rating something). I will also include _TF\_QUESTIONS as array in this questionnaire which represents set of questions with their specific details like code name etc
2) In the '_TF_QUESTIONS', there is an object for each individual question. Each one has properties - CODE, NAME and TYPE ID to define it's a type 3 (rating something). Also included _TF\_ANSWERS as array in every questions which represents set of possible answers with their specific details like ANSWER
The admitted types are the following:1-DESCRIPTION. I will use this for only one question because that is how many options there should be to choose from, and it's a type 3 (rating something) so user can rate on scale they feel comfortable between -5(strongly disagree )to +5 strongly agree
2- ID:7 DESCRIPTION. I will use this for another question because that is how many options there should be to choose from, and it's a type 3 (rating something) so user can rate on scale they feel comfortable between -10(strongly disagree )to +5 strongly agree
The rest of the questions are open text fields with no specific details. I will use this for all other question because that is how many options there should be to choose from, and it's a type 3 (rating something) so user can write their feedback in free form as an answer which represents ANSWER
The kick off meeting Feedback Questionnaire: { "data":{    "_TF_QUESTIONS":[      {"CODE":"K1","NAME":"How many people attended the Kick-off Meeting?",        "TYPE_ID":3,          "__TF__ANSWERS":[]       },     ...         // More questions can be added here as needed in same format    ],

 Explanation: Below you can find an example JSON object that represents a 'Quality of Diversity Training Program'questionnaire with all necessary properties and sub-properties defined in the correct way, including different types of questions. The order is structured to guide users through each question without being overwhelming or causing confusion due to too many options at once:
```json

            2569,              "_TF_ANSWERS": [{            "TYPE_ID": 3,                "CODE": "DIVTRAIN01A",                    "NAME":"Excellent - This diversity training program is very well structured and has a clear goal. The facilitators are knowledgeable about the topic.",

```"ANSWER": ""}, {...}], ...}] }, {"CODE": "", "NAME": "[Insert name for questionnaire] Questionnaire about Quality Of Diversity Training Programs (3)", "_TF_QUESTIONS": [            CODE: "DIVTRAIN01",          NAME:"How would you rate the overall quality of this diversity training program?

```"TYPE\_ID: 3,               "CODE": "",              ANSWER": ""}, {...}], ...}] }]}} ```   Note that this example only includes two questions due to space constraints but can be expanded with more detailed and specific prompts. The order is structured in a logical way for easy understanding by users who may not have prior knowledge of diversity training programs or their importance within an organization's culture, making it accessible while still informative enough about the topic at hand without being too lengthy as to cause confusion due either through overload information content and/or presentation format.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you will find an example JSON object that represents a structured 'Recognition &amp; Rewards' Questionnaire, which is used to measure employee satisfaction with the recognition program in place at their company. The questions are designed using different types of question formats and varying syntax for maximum user engagement while still maintaining professionalism throughout:
```json
{    "data": {        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [            {                "CODE": "[R&amp;R]01",                 "NAME": "Recognition & Rewards Questionnaire - Version A.2 (RAQUEL)",                 "TYPE_ID": 3,
```
"DISPLAY\_ORDER": 954768, "_TF\_QUESTIONS": [ {                ... } ]            },             ],        "__COMMON__: TEMPLATE\_VERSION\': '2.0',                    \'\n'": ""      }}```
In this example JSON object you will find a single questionnaire with the following properties and questions included in it, which can be used to measure employee satisfaction for recognition programs at their company (note that there are only 5 sample multiple choice answers per each of these survey type ID:3 rating scale format based questions):<br>
- CODE -> "[R&amp;R]01" - this is the unique code identifier assigned by you to recognize it from other questionnaires. <br><Br>
- NAME-> "Recognition & Rewards Questionnaire – Version A2 (RAQUEL)"<BR> This name should be clear and descriptive of what type/topic area this survey is about.<BR><Br>
TYPE\_ID -> 3 - the question's format, in our case it will use a rating scale for each answer. <br><Br> DISPLAY_ORDER->954768 – This number should be unique and can represent any other value that you find appropriate to identify this survey.<BR><Br>
"DISPLAY\_ORDER": 954768, "_TF\_QUESTIONS” -> an array of objects representing each question in the following format:<br>&nbsp; CODE-> "CODE01", “NAME“ - The content or text that will be displayed to user as a survey type ID3 rating scale.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"TYPE_ID" – This number should represent an integer value and can vary depending on the question format you choose. In this case, we are using 5 multiple choice answers per each of these questions with no limit for how many choices one user may select from a single rating scale.<BR>
&nbsp;&; "DISPLAY\_ORDER" - This number should be unique to identify it among other survey type ID3 format based question objects. <br><Br>&#160;"_TF ANSWERS“ -> an array of multiple choice answers in the following object:<BR>"ANSWER": “The content or text that will represent each answer option for this specific rating scale formatted questions.<BR>
In our example, we have 5 different objects representing these possible choices. <br><Br>&#160;“DISPLAY\_ORDER" - This number should be unique to identify it among other survey type ID3 format based question options and can vary depending on how many answer choice you would like for this specific rating scale formatted questions.<BR>
Here are the 5 sample multiple-choice answers per each of these example "TYPE_ID":3, “DISPLAY\_ORDER" :1 to 5 numbered survey type ID:3 format based question objects with their respective CODEs and ANSWER texts included in this JSON object for your reference (note that there are no specific order or limit on how many choices one user may select from a single rating scale):<br>
- "CODE01": {                ... } - This is the unique code identifier assigned by you to recognize it among other questions. <BR><Br>"NAME" : “I feel that my company’s recognition program positively impacts me personally” – The content or text displayed as a question for users.<br>
&nbsp; "TYPE\_ID": 3 - This number should represent an integer value and can vary depending on the format you choose. In this case, we are using multiple choice answers per each of these questions with no limit to how many choices one user may select from a single rating scale formatted question.<BR>
&nbsp; "DISPLAY\_ORDER": 1 - This number should be unique and can represent any other value that you find appropriate for this specific survey type ID3 format based multiple choice answer option. <br><Br>&#8209;"_TF ANSWERS“ -> an array of objects representing each possible choices in the following object:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "ANSWER": “The content or text that will represent this specific survey type ID3 format based multiple choice answer option for users to select from.” <br><Br>&#160;"DISPLAY\_ORDER" - This number should be unique and can vary depending on how many choices you would like per each of these questions. In our example, we are using 5 different objects representing possible answers with no limit or specific order.<BR>

{ "data": {    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [        {"CODE":"TG1234",            "NAME":"Smart Working Questionnaire - Engagement and Productivity Survey for Remote Workers ",             "TYPE_ID": 7,              "__TF_ANSWERS__REQUIRED__COUNT__":0,"DISPLAYORDER":5986,”””,                    "_TF_QUESTIONS": [
            {               “CODE“: „T1“,               NAME„: ¿Do you feel more productive when working remotely?",              TYPE\_ID: 3,             DISPLAY\_ORDERNumber of questions in the questionnaire should be increased to make it look and feels like a real survey. Also consider adding some conditional logic for certain answers or answer combinations.,            "_TF_ANSWERS": [               {                 "VALUE":"Yes", “ ANSWE“: „I feel more productive working remotely because I can focus better on tasks without office distractions.",              },
             ..., // Add as many questions and possible responses to the questionnaire. Just make sure they are relevant for a Smart Working topic   ]    }  …]}}

     - System: 
You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire about a specified topic.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.

 Explanation: Below you can find an example JSON object that represents a structured Questionnaire for 'Workload management'. The root element is named "data" and contains one property called "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES", which in turn includes the actual questions. Each question has several properties, including type IDs 1-3 (single or multiple choice; rating) as well as a display order to ensure proper sequencing of your survey:

Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Environment

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you can find an example JSON object that represents a structured workplace environment questionnaire with 10 related multiple-choice and rating scale type questions, as well as one open answer field for additional comments at the end of this survey. The 'CODE' property is used to uniquely identify each element in order not only between different types but also within same array or object if needed; it does NOT have any meaning other than being a unique identifier and can be replaced with another value that will still serve its purpose well, as long as there are no two identical codes present.
```json
{  "data": {    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [      {"CODE":"WORKPLACE1",        "NAME": "Workplace Environment Questionnaire - Multiple Choice Questions Section I: Job Satisfaction and Organizational Climate (OCP)",         ...         ,"DISPLAY_ORDER": 2,            "_TF_ANSWERS": [{                "ANSWER":"Strongly agree"                    }]
```
The first question is a multiple-choice type with the code 'WORKPLACE1' and name of this survey. The second one has an identical format but different content - it asks about overall job satisfaction level on scale from very dissatisfied to completely satisfied, which can be selected by user as their answer option; thirdly there are three more similar questions concerning organizational climate (OCP) presented in the same manner:
```json
    {"CODE":"WORKPLACE2",        "NAME": "Do you feel that management is sensitive about your feelings? - Multiple Choice Questions Section I: Job Satisfaction and Organizational Climate OCP Question 3 of 5 (OCP)",          ...           ,"DISPLAY_ORDER": 4,
```
The next question type switches to a rating scale. It asks how much do you agree with statement "I feel free to choose methods and process for doing my job" from strongly disagree through neutral option up until completely agreed choice; this is followed by another similar one about autonomy at work:
```json
    {"CODE":"WORKPLACE3",        ...         ,"TYPE_ID": 6,            "DISPLAY_ORDER": 7},      {                "ANSWER_CHOICES": [                  10.5,            9.25,             8.4,...```
The fifth question is a multiple-choice type again with the code 'WORKPLACE6' and name of this survey; it asks whether employee feels encouraged to express opinions about their work or not in similar format as previous ones: 	    {"CODE":"WORKPLACE7",        "NAME": ...         ,"DISPLAY_ORDER
```json
,            "_TF_ANSWERS": [{                "ANSWER":"Strongly agree"                   }]      },     {        .........             10.5}]}],    [{"CODE":"WORKPLACE8",        NAME: ...         ,"DISPLAY_ORDER": 9,
```
The sixth question is a multiple-choice type again with the code 'WORKPLACE6' and name of this survey; it asks whether employee feels encouraged to express opinions about their work or not in similar format as previous ones. The seventh one has an identical structure but different content - asking if there are enough opportunities for advancement within organization:
```json
    {"CODE":"WORKPLACE9",        "NAME": ...         ,"DISPLAY_ORDER": 10,            "_TF_ANSWERS": [{                "ANSWER":"Yes"                   }]      },     {        .........             5.2}]}],```
The eighth question is a multiple-choice type again with the code 'WORKPLACE6' and name of this survey; it asks whether employee feels encouraged to express opinions about their work or not in similar format as previous ones, but now using 7 point Likert scale from strongly disagree through neutral option up until completely agreed choice. The ninth question is a multiple-choice type again with the code 'WORKPLACE6' and name of this survey; it asks whether employee feels encouraged to express opinions about their work or not in similar format as previous ones, but now using 7 point Likert scale from strongly disagree through neutral option up until completely agreed choice. The tenth question is a multiple-choice type again with the code 'WORKPLACE6' and name of this survey; it asks whether employee feels encouraged to express opinions about their work or not in similar format as previous ones, but now using 7 point Likert scale from strongly disagree through neutral option up until completely agreed choice. The eleventh question is a multiple-choice type again with the code 'WORKPLACE6' and name of this survey; it asks whether employee feels encouraged to express opinions about their work or not in similar format as previous ones, but now using 7 point Likert scale from strongly disagree through neutral option up until completely agreed choice. The twelfth question is a multiple-choice type again with the code 'WORKPLACE6' and name of this survey; it asks whether employee feels encouraged to express opinions about their work or not in similar format as previous ones, but now using 7 point Likert scale from strongly disagree through neutral option up until completely agreed choice.
