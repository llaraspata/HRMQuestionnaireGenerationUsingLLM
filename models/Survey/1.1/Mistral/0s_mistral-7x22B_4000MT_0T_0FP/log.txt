[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation:
The questionnaire is structured as follows:

1. The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
2. 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
3. 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire.
4. Each questionnaire has the following properties:
   - 'CODE': 'EMPLOYEE_POTENTIAL'
   - 'NAME': 'Employee Potential Questionnaire'
   - 'TYPE_ID': 3
   - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of only three elements, each representing a question.

The three questions are designed to evaluate employee potential and are as follows:

Question 1:
{
  "CODE": "Q1_EMPLOYEE_POTENTIAL",
  "NAME": "On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely are you to recommend this employee to a friend or colleague?",
  "TYPE_ID": 3,
  "DISPLAY_ORDER": 1,
  "_TF_ANSWERS": [
    {
      "ANSWER": "1"
    },
    {
      "ANSWER": "2"
    },
    {
      "ANSWER": "3"
    },
    {
      "ANSWER": "4"
    },
    {
      "ANSWER": "5"
    },
    {
      "ANSWER": "6"
    },
    {
      "ANSWER": "7"
    },
    {
      "ANSWER": "8"
    },
    {
      "ANSWER": "9"
    },
    {
      "ANSWER": "10"
    }
  ]
},
Question 2:
{
  "CODE": "Q2_EMPLOYEE_POTENTIAL",
  "NAME": "Does this employee have the potential to be a leader in the organization?",
  "TYPE_ID": 3,
  "DISPLAY_ORDER": 2,
  "_TF_ANSWERS": [
    {
      "ANSWER": "Strongly agree"
    },
    {
      "ANSWER": "Agree"
    },
    {
      "ANSWER": "Neutral"
    },
    {
      "ANSWER": "Disagree"
    },
    {
      "ANSWER": "Strongly disagree"
    }
  ]
},
Question 3:
{
  "CODE": "Q3_EMPLOYEE_POTENTIAL",
  "NAME": "Is this employee always looking for ways to improve processes and is a change agent?",
  "TYPE_ID": 3,
  "DISPLAY_ORDER": 3,
  "_TF_ANSWERS": [
    {
      "ANSWER": "Always looking for ways to improve processes and is a change agent"
    },
    {
      "ANSWER": "Sometimes looking for ways to improve processes and is a change agent"
    },
    {
      "ANSWER": "Neutral"
    },
    {
      "ANSWER": "Not always looking for ways to improve processes and is not a change agent"
    },
    {
      "ANSWER": "Never looking for ways to improve processes and is not a change agent"
    }
