[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation:
The questionnaire is structured as a JSON object with a single property 'data'. Within 'data' is an array called 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'. Each element of 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' represents a questionnaire and has the following properties: 'CODE', 'NAME', 'TYPE_ID', and '_TF_QUESTIONS'. 'TYPE_ID' is always equal to 3 because this questionnaire uses only rate-style questions. '_TF_QUESTIONS' is an array of question objects, and each question has the following properties: 'CODE', 'NAME', 'TYPE_ID', and '_TF_ANSWERS'. 'TYPE_ID' is always equal to 1 because all questions are of type "rate".

Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.

This is a JSON object that represents a questionnaire about career goals. There are 10 questions in this questionnaire, and each question has a unique code, name, and type. The type of each question is 3, which I believe indicates that it is a Likert scale question. The answers to each question are also specified, with 5 possible answers: Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, and Strongly Disagree.

 Explanation:

The questionnaire is structured as a JSON object containing a single property 'data'. The 'data' property contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES', which is an array of questionnaires. Each questionnaire has the following properties: 'CODE', 'NAME', 'TYPE_ID', '_TF_QUESTIONS', and '_TF_ANSWERS'.

The '_TF_QUESTIONS' property is an array of questions, and each question has the following properties: 'CODE', 'NAME', 'TYPE_ID', 'DISPLAY_ORDER', and '_TF_ANSWERS'.

The '_TF_ANSWERS' property is an array of possible answers to the question.

Below is the JSON object for a questionnaire on Career Path Clarity with 7 questions:

This is a list of 10 survey questions about employee engagement and satisfaction. Each question is designed to assess a different aspect of the employee's work experience, such as communication, resources, and alignment with company values. The questions are presented in a simple, easy-to-understand format, and the answers are rated on a scale of 1 to 10. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of each employee's feelings, as a simple "yes" or "no" answer might not provide the necessary context. Additionally, the use of a 10-point scale allows for a more nuanced understanding of each employee's feelings, as a simple "yes" or "no" answer might not provide the necessary context.

One potential issue with this format is that it might be difficult to analyze the results and identify trends or common themes without the use of a survey platform or other data analysis tool. However, the simplicity and ease of use of these questions make them a good starting point for gathering feedback and understanding the work environment.

Here are the questions:

1. Is the current performance evaluation system fair?
2. Do you think the current goals and objectives for your department are clear and measurable?
3. On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate the communication skills of your manager?
4. Do you feel like you have enough resources to perform your job effectively?
5. Do you think the company's values and mission align with your personal values?
6. On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate the work-life balance provided by the company?
7. Do you feel motivated to perform at your best?
8. Is the feedback you receive helpful and timely?
9. Do you think the company's decisions are transparent?
10. Do you feel like a valued member of the team?

These questions can be used to gather valuable feedback about the work environment and can help management identify areas for improvement and ways to increase employee satisfaction and engagement. By using a 10-point scale, it is possible to gather more nuanced information about each employee's feelings, which can be particularly useful when analyzing the responses of a large group.

The questions are also tagged with specific tags to provide additional information about them. The answers for each question are also predefined, and the user can only choose from the provided options. The questions are numbered, but I've also provided a display order to make sure the questions are displayed in the correct order. The type of each question is also specified, and in this case, all questions are rated type questions.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation:
The questionnaire is structured as a JSON object with a single property 'data'. Within 'data', there is another property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' which is an array containing a single object representing the questionnaire. This object has four properties: 'CODE', 'NAME', 'TYPE_ID', and '_TF_QUESTIONS'. The '_TF_QUESTIONS' property is an array of objects, each representing a question. Each question object has four properties: 'CODE', 'NAME', 'TYPE_ID', and '_TF_ANSWERS'. The '_TF_ANSWERS' array is not included in this example, as it is not needed for a questionnaire of type "Rate".

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation:
The questionnaire is structured as a JSON object with a single property 'data'. This 'data' property contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' which is an array of questionnaires. In this case, there is only one questionnaire in the array. Each questionnaire has a 'CODE', 'NAME', 'TYPE_ID', and '_TF_QUESTIONS' property. The '_TF_QUESTIONS' property is an array of objects, each representing a question. Each question has a 'CODE', 'NAME', 'TYPE_ID', and 'DISPLAY_ORDER' property. The 'TYPE_ID' property is used to determine the type of question, for example, multiple choice, rating, or date. The 'DISPLAY_ORDER' property is used to order the questions.
