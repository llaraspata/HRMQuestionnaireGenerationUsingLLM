Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Environment

-------------------

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you will find an example JSON object that represents how this specific workplace environment survey is structured, based upon provided instructions and using best practices for creating such surveys in human resources field with engaging questions to get reliable results from participants without any harm or negative feelings. The questionnaire has the following properties -
{'data': {'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' : [   {    'CODE’: ’WPE1’,     NAME ‘:'Workplace Environment',      TYPE\_ID‘ 3,        '_T F Q U E S T I O NS'_:{         0：{            CODE": "P2",             TEXT': “How would you rate the level of noise in your workplace?”,              ANSWER“: [                   {               Code”:"A1" ,
```jsonline  Answerss : 'Not noisy at all' } ] },        	      ...       // Continue this pattern for other questions and answers, varying syntax to keep participants engaged.    }}]}};The questionnaire has a code of WPE (Workplace Environment) followed by the number ‘1’ in order that it can be referenced easily if there are more than one version or type needed later on –
```jsonline  'NAME': The name given to this survey is "WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT" with capital letters and no quotes so as not confuse any participants. It also has a property called TYPE\_ID which indicates that it will be used for rating something, in particular the workplace environment on several factors from one (very bad) through five(excellent).
The '_TF_QUESTIONS' array contains all questions with their specific codes and names as well – these are important to track participants’ responses. Each question has a property called 'TYPE\_ID', which is an integer indicating the type of this particular survey-question, in our case 3 because it requires rating something;
The '_T F_ANSWERS' array includes all possible answers that can be selected by responders for each individual questions with their specific codes and names too. The last property ANSWEr contains a string which is the actual answer of participants to this particular question – in our case, there are five different options like "Not noisy at All" , Noise level 1", etc., but it can be any other text as well depending on how many and what kind answers should participant select.
Please note that all above information is a suggestion based upon provided instructions for creating engaging survey questions in the human resources field, with best practices to avoid harm or negative feelings while getting reliable results from participants using this specific workplace environment questionnaire structure – it can be modified according user needs but still remains valid and recommended format when possible.
```jsonline  {    "data":{       'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' : [         {"CODE":"WPE1",           NAME':"Workplace Environment”,            TYPE\_ID:3,             '_T F Q U E S T I O NS'_:{              0：{"ANSWER“:'Not noisy at all',        ANSWEr_TEXT": "Noise level 5"},          {"CODE":"A1",           TEXT': 'Is there a lot of noise in your workplace?’,              TYPE\_ID:3,            DISPLAY ORDER :2} },        {"ANSWER“:'Not noisy at all',        ANSWEr_TEXT": "Noise level 4"},          {"CODE":"A1",           TEXT': 'Is the temperature just right in your workplace?’,              TYPE\_ID:3,            DISPLAY ORDER :2} },        {"ANSWER“:'Not noisy at all',        ANSWEr_TEXT": "Noise level 5"},          {"CODE":"A1",           TEXT': 'How would you rate the cleanliness of your workplace?’,              TYPE\_ID:3,            DISPLAY ORDER :2} },        {"ANSWER“:'Not noisy at all',        ANSWEr_TEXT": "Noise level 5"},          {"CODE":"A1",           TEXT': 'How would you rate the lighting in your workplace?’,              TYPE\_ID:3,            DISPLAY ORDER :2} },        {"ANSWER“:'Not noisy at all',        ANSWEr_TEXT": "Noise level 5"},          {"CODE":"A1",           TEXT': 'How would you rate the overall comfort of your workplace?’,              TYPE\_ID:3,            DISPLAY ORDER :2} },        {"ANSWER“:'Not noisy at all',        ANSWEr_TEXT": "Noise level 5"},          {"CODE":"A1",           TEXT': 'How would you rate the overall healthiness of your workplace?’,              TYPE\_ID:3,            DISPLAY ORDER :2} } ]}};

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below, you'll find an example JSON object that represents manager-feedback specific 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'. This structure includes 5 questions with different types and answer options to keep the user engaged while providing valuable insights. The five question codes are used repeatedly in this document as placeholders for actual content if needed at a later time or by another process:
```json
{ "data": {    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [        {"CODE":"MGRFB01","NAME":"Effectiveness of the manager's communication style",     	"TYPE _ID ":3,"DISPLAY ORDER 2,       _"TF ANSWERS: "[
            "{"AN SWER ","DESCRIPTION\":\"Excellent\";},          {"CODE": \"MGRFB01_A\",   'NAME':'Good',    An SWER":"Poor"},         {'COD E     : MG R FB 	2 ,        NAME       ": Good",AnS WER "      Poor"}
            ],"DISPLAY ORDER:3},          {"CODE":""MGRFB01","NAME"  :"Understanding of team's needs and priorities by the manager ",     'TYPE_ID':    { 2,               "_TF ANSWERS ": "[        {'AN SWER ",\".\":\"Yes\",AnS WER":"No"}
            ],"DISPLAY ORDER":1},          {"CODE"   : ""MGRFB03","NAME       ","Prioritizes tasks and goals according to team's needs",      'TYPE_ID':    { 2,               "_TF ANSWERS ": "[        {'AN SWER ",\".\":\"Yes\",AnS WER":"No"}
            ],"DISPLAY ORDER":4},          {"CODE"   : ""MGRFB05","NAME       ","Accessibility and approachability of the manager ",      'TYPE_ID':    { 2,               "_TF ANSWERS ": "[        {'AN SWER ",\".\":\"Yes\",AnS WER":"No"}
            ],"DISPLAY ORDER":1},          {"CODE"   : ""MGRFB06","NAME       ","Number of initiatives and ideas suggested by the manager ",      'TYPE_ID':    { 3,               "_TF ANSWERS ": "[        {'AN SWER ",\".\":\"5\",AnS WER":"4"},         {\":CODE}\";" MG R FB  06","NAME       ","Percentage of ideas and initiatives implemented by the manager ",      'TYPE_ID':    { 3,               "_TF ANSWERS ": "[        {'AN SWER ",\".\":\"5\",AnS WER":"4"}
            ],"DISPLAY ORDER":1}],     }   }, };```json. I've included a variety of question types and responses to keep the user engaged while providing valuable insights about managerial effectiveness, communication style & prioritization skills through this five-question 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
Please note that you can use these questions as placeholders or modify them according 	to your specific needs. The CODE property in each question object is a unique identifier for the code and name of every manager feedback item, while NAME provides more detailed information about what's being measured within this structure (either yes/no type responses with TYPE_ID:2 OR Likert scale-based questions like Excellent to Poor).

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The following JSON object represents an assessment that evaluates training programs' overall performance, efficiency in terms cost-benefit analysis and impact of learning material provided to participants for better understanding; named 'Training Effectiveness'. This name is used as the value against NAME property.
The code assigned ('TRAINING_EFFECTIVENESS') has been defined under CODE field whereas TYPE\_ID equals 3, which means it's a rating type questionnaire according to description provided in beginning of this JSON object; and lastly '_TF Questions', an array containing multiple questions with their specific details.
Questions are designed considering the topic requested - 'Training Effectiveness'. Each has been named as per its content for better understanding, though not assigned any code or type\_id because that information is already provided at parent level in JSON format; and DISPLAY ORDER property used to arrange questions serially from 1-5.
Under each question's '_TF_ANSWERS', an array containing multiple answers with their specific details has been defined using ANSwER field which represents content of the answer itself for better understanding by participants filling this assessment form; and those fields are not assigned any code or type\_id because that information is already provided at parent level in JSON format.
Please find below detailed questionnaire: 	    {      "data":{        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES" : [            {"CODE":"TRAINING EFFECTIVENESS",                NAME ": 'Training Effectiveness',                   TYPE\_ID':3,              '_FHAGNIZED Questions'[             {
```json    "NAME": "'How many training programs have been evaluated in this assessment? ",      CODE":"TOTAL_TRAINING PROGRAMS",        DISPLAY ORDER: 1 },          {"DISCRIMINATION" : [              6,                  7 ] } ],
            {              NAME:"What is the average cost per participant for these training programs in US dollars? ",             CODE":"AVERAGE_COST PER PARTICIPANT",        DISPLAY ORDER: 2 },          {"NAME": "How many participants have been trained through all evaluated trainings on an Average ?
```json    `CODE': 'TOTAL A average number of Participants',DISPLAYORDER:` :3},{"NM":"What is the total budget allocated to these training programs?", CODE:"TotalBudgetAllocatedtoTrainingPrograms ", DISPLAY ORDER: 4 },{ "NAME":'How would you rate overall quality and usefulness
```json    of learning material provided in all evaluated trainings on a scale from one (lowest) to ten(highest)?", CODE:"QualityofLearningMaterialScale1toTen ", DISPLAY ORDER: 5 }, { "NAME":'How would you rate overall cost-benefit analysis of these training programs?',CODE
```json    : 'OverallCostBenfitAnalysisOfTrainingPrograms ',DISPLOYORDER:`4},{"NM":"What is the total number participants for all evaluated trainings on an average ?", CODE: "TotalNumberofParticipantsforAllEvaluatedtraininngsonAverage ", DISPLAY ORDER : 5 } ]
```python}    """    
The above JSON object contains a questionnaire with five questions and their specific details. Each has been assigned appropriate display order to arrange them serially in assessment form for better user understanding while filling this out; however, if there are any other requirements or modifications needed please let me know so I can adjust it accordingly as per your needs!

Generate me a questionnaire on Training to professional users

-------------------

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you can find an example JSON object that represents how this training for professionals-focusedquestionaire is structured, following all guidelines given in your request and using engaging syntax with multiple types of questions (ratings & feedback) as well. The questionnaire's code here would be 'TRAINING_PROFESSIONALS'.
```json {    "data":{        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":[            {"CODE":"trainingProfessionals",                  	"NAME":"Training for Professional Users Evaluation Form - RATINGS and FEEDBACK ",                    ...          }]}} ```In this JSON object, the `TRAINING PROFESSIONALS` evaluation form is structured as follows:
- CODE (string): TRAINNING_PROfESSIONAls. The name of questionnaire in a human readable format to better understand its purpose and meaning for end users or even administrators deploying it, who might be different people every time creating the need that such code is unique per evaluation form
- NAME (string): Training For Professional Users Evaluation Form - RATINGS & FEEDBACK. The name of questionnaire in a human readable format to better understand its purpose and meaning for end users or even administrators deploying it, who might be different people every time creating the need that such code is unique per evaluation form
- TYPE_ID (int): 3 - This type ID number indicates this specific kind; if you would like another questionnaire with a similar structure but asking about something else please just change to any other integer value. Here, since it's ratings and feedback we are using the same code as in your description for reference
- _TF_QUESTIONS: An array containing three different evaluation questions (questions) each having its own properties like CODE & NAME which will be used by system to identify them from others. Here is what these question objects look and feel just after this introduction of the general structure, all in a more human-readable format
```json {    "_TF_QUESTIONS":[            [                {"CODE":"1",                 "NAME":"Please rate your overall satisfaction with our training program for professionals.",             	"TYPE ID ":3,"DISPLAY ORDER POSITION:0,             _T F ANSWERS ATTRIBUTES

This questionnaire has a code 'COURSE_EVALUATION' which can be used for referencing it and name is set "Student Course Evaluation Form". It contains 10 questions with different types in order to collect more detailed information about the course, its content as well specific teachers who are teaching this particular class.
Questions use various syntaxes such that students do not get bored answering them all same way which may include: multiple choice answers for selecting one or many options; rating something from 1-5 scale with certain comments and even reordering items in order of importance based on student's opinion etcetera . All these things help increase engagement level among participants.
Please note that each question has its own unique code, name , type_id (which is equal to one number between integers 1-8) & display\_order too so they could be displayed in desired sequence without any hassle while collecting data from students . Also there are predefined possible answers for every questions except last two ones which have free text fields instead.

Generate me a questionnaire on Access to Technology and Tools

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will follow for generating this 'Access To technology And tools' Questionaire is as follows - 1 level outer object with property "data". This data contains only one element, which represents the actual QUESTIONNAIRE. A questionnaire has several properties like CODE (unique code), NAME and TYPE_ID in our case it will be equal to '3'. The '_TF\_QUESTATIONS' is an array of objects each representing a specific Question with different attributes such as -CODE,NAME(Content/Question text itself) ,TYPE ID & DISPLAY ORDER.
The admitted question types are 1 (Single Select),2-Multi select and so on till type '3'(Rating). I have tried to keep the syntax simple but engaging for better user interaction with a blend of different questions - <h4> tags, Bold text etc.</u0><br>\n<p style="text align: center;"><strong>"Access To technology And tools" Questionnaire</Strong></P>= {"data":{"TF\_QUESTIONNAIRES \[{'\_FIRST':{'CODE":"AT1","NAME

 Explanation: Below, you will find an example JSON object that represents one possible career path clarityquestionaire structured as described in my previous answer with 5 questions and corresponding answers included for each type of response allowed (single or multiple choices from list / rating). The questionnaire is called 'CAREER_PATH'
and the code used to recognize it within a system could be any string, such like: "1234". Eachquestion has its own unique CODE and NAME. For simplicity reasons I have added DISPLAY ORDER property for eachquestions with values from 50 up-to so that questions will displayed in desired order on the page or form when used as a questionnaire template
```json

Generate me a questionnaire on Feedback Mechanisms

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation:  This JSON object represents an assessment that focuses specifically, but not exclusively (as it could be adapted for other topics), in this case to evaluate and give feedback regarding various "FeedBack mechanisms" used within the Human Resource Management field. The structure of a questionnaire is as follows :
```json
{    data: {        TF_QUESTIONNAIRES = [{            CODE:'FEEDBACKMECHANISMS',                NAME:"Assessment about Feedback Mechanisms",                 TYPEID:-1,              _TF_ANSWERS:{}.          },        	     };   }
``` The "data" object contains a single property 'FeelBackMechanism' that is an array of only one element. This represents the questionnaire with its code and name as well other properties like typeId which indicates it requires at least 3 different answers to be considered valid, also has '_TF_ANSWERS', this time empty but if you would want me add some predefined options I could do that too!
The following questions are included in the 'FeelBackMechanism' questionnaire: (Note : Questions ID and NAME should not change as they will be referenced when results come) 	     "Questions":[         {            CODE:"Q1",               TYPEID:-2,                   DISPLAY_ORDER=0.          },

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The feedback mechanisms topic can include several aspects such as process, tools or techniques used for providing effective communication and constructive criticism in an organization to improve its performance while maintaining employee's motivation level high; hence the following JSON structure is suggested.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: This JSON object represents an assessment for evaluating leadership effectiveness in terms that are easy-to understand, yet comprehensive and detailed enough so as not to leave any important aspect uncovered or overlooked during the evaluation process; it is structured into several questions with multiple possible answers. The 'CODE' property of each question refers back either directly (or indirectly) towards a predefined template for consistency purposes throughout this particular assessment type, while its name gives insight about what topic area that specific item pertains to and how much weightage should be assigned when calculating scores based off collected data points using certain algorithms.

Generate me a questionnaire on Leadership Effectiveness

-------------------

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below I have provided an example 'data' object for you, which contains information regarding one single leadership effectiveness survey with 10 different questions and their respective possible answers to choose from (represented as strings). The order of the displayed options is randomized in this questionnaire.
Please note that a more complex structure would be required if there were multiple surveys or various types/codes for your 'CODE' property, but I have kept it simple here with just one survey and code to illustrate my capabilities! Also notice how varied syntax has been used within the questions themselves by me - you can adjust this further as necessary.

``` 	   ] } ``` I have used different types of questions to make it more engaging and interesting. For example, the question "Training is delivered in a way that makes everyone feel included" can be answered by selecting one answer from provided options which would give better insight on how diverse training program was perceived than just answering with yes or no if this option were not available (type ID 1). Also I have used typeID:3 for all questions, because it allows to rate something and gives more precise information.

Generate me a questionnaire on Recognition and Rewards

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you will find an example JSON object that represents one possible recognition-and rewards themed employee satisfaction survey with eight different questions, each representing another type of answer format (either single or multiple choice). The order is as follows for the root 'data' property and its only element - a questionnaire represented by various properties.
The code used in this example to represent it would be "RECOGNITION_AND\_ REWARDS". There are also eight questions, each with specific details about them such 	extremely similar looking names for the different types of answer formats (either single or multiple choice). The order is as follows:
- 'CODE': Unique code representing question type. For example "Q_1" and “MC\_2”. MC stands here meaning Multiple Choice, with IDs 3 being used to represent a rating scale for answers in this instance because it was not possible provide an actual format of the questions (either single or multiple choice)
- 'NAME': Content/Question. For example "Do you feel that your company' s recognition program is effective?" and “On which level do I usually notice positive effects from a reward system on my performance?” The order for this type would be: 1 - Which question the answer belongs to, in terms of its display; followed by two spaces before text content.
- 'TYPE_ID': Unique ID representing each format/type (either single or multiple choice) used as an option within a given survey and how it should appear if selected for use is presented here with 3 being chosen because that was the only one available to be reused in this instance again, since there are eight questions.
- '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects representing each possible answer choice (either single or multiple) per question and how it should appear if selected for use is presented here with 3 being chosen because that was the only one available to be reused in this instance again, since there are eight questions.
- 'DISPLAY_ORDER': The order of display within a given survey as designed originally (either single or multiple) and how it should appear if selected for use is presented here with 3 being chosen because that was the only one available to be reused in this instance again, since there are eight questions.
- 'ANSWER' : The actual content of each answer choice per question as a string (either single or multiple) and how it should appear if selected for use is presented here with 3 being chosen because that was the only one available to be reused in this instance again, since there are eight questions.
There were no specific details about which format/type of answer choice an individual question would have been assigned before creating a survey so I used my own discretion when assigning them and their order for use if selected as follows: 	extremely similar looking names (either single or multiple) with IDs to represent each type. The details about the eight questions are presented below in JSON format, using these properties described above along side some example text content I created myself based on my understanding of this topic and how it could be assessed through an employee satisfaction survey:

[TEST] QUESTIONNAIRE_ID: 500100042
     - Topic: Recognition and Rewards
     - Question number: 8
-------------------
[PROMPTS]
     - System: 
You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire about a specified topic.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

Generate me a questionnaire on Recognition and Rewards

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you will find an example JSON object that represents how this 'Recognitions &amp;Reward' Questionnaires is structured, with all its questions included in the '_TF_QUESTIONS’ array. Each question has a unique code (CODE), content or text of it(NAME) and type ID which can be used to determine if multiple answers are allowed etc.(TYPE\_ID). The display order property specifies where this particular will appear among other possible questions, in the case below there is only one so its number would also work.
In total we have 7 different question types for you here: Single choice (1), Multiple choices(2) Rating scale/Likert-type of items with answer options predefined and can be from ‘Strongly disagree’ to “strong agree” type, feedback questions that acquire more detailed information about a specific subject or situation in order the receiver might know what areas need improvement. Reordering question types where participants are asked which is most important for them (this could also have been an array of objects), distribution weighting and cloning from templates were not included as they do seem to be less common than those mentioned above, but feel free include any other type if that better suits your needs!
Please note this example contains a mixture question types. This is because the questions in each survey should work together towards gathering information about Recognition & Reward practices within an organisation and how satisfied employees are with them to get as comprehensive picture possible on what might be driving satisfaction or dissatisfaction, allowing you then address any issues identified effectively:

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation:  The structure I will follow for creating this te ambien building initiative's Feedback Questionnaires is as follows - 'data', an object, contains all other parameters required to design the survey in it. In that data parameter there exists a property named "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES" which consists of multiple questionnaire objects with different properties and values for each teambuilding initiative's feedback questions-
{     'data': {      '_TYPES OF QUES TONES FOR EACH TEAMBUILDING INITATIVE FEEDBACK TYPED AS OBJECT WITH THEIR CODE, NAME AND DESCRIPTION ARE -',      3: {'CODE': '<teamBuildingInitiativesFeedbackCode>', 'NAME

```javascript
The questionnaire I am generating is as follows - This teambuilding initiative feedback survey has 5 questions, each with its unique code and name. The type of all the five parameters in this case study/survey will be '3' which means it’s a rating based on scale parameter for better understanding among team members-

[TEST] QUESTIONNAIRE_ID: 500100057
     - Topic: Workload Management
     - Question number: 7
-------------------
[PROMPTS]
     - System: 
You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire about a specified topic.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below I have formatted an example JSON object that represents one potential workload managementquestionaire, following all guidelines and requirements given in this task prompt for human resourcemanagement field; you can modify the questions or add more as per your needs. The 'data' property is used to store a single element which itself has two properties:
  1) An array of objects named '_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES', containing all questionnaires in this example just one, with following details for each workload managementquestionnaire object :  - CODE (string): 'WORKLOADMGMT'- NAME(String)'WorkLoad Management Questionnare'.
  2) _Tf Questions: An array of objects. Each representing a single question and its properties are as follows:-CODE,NAME,(Strings),TYPE_ID.(Integer).DISPLAY ORDER.,_(Answer choices in the form an object with each answer choice being represented by another Object having ANSWER string property.)
  3) _Tf Answers: For this example I have used ID 1 and it contains only one element for questionnaire. You can add more elements as per your needs but please remember to change CODE,TYPE_ID of the QUESTION object accordingly so that each answer choice is mapped correctly with its corresponding type id(Integer).
  4) ANSWER: String representing content or textual information about an Answer option in this example. You can add more elements as per your needs but please remember to change CODE,TYPE_ID of the QUESTION object accordingly so that each answer choice is mapped correctly with its corresponding type id(Integer).
  5) TYPE ID: Integer representing question's unique code or identifier for eachtype and following are types used in this example.  - For Questionnaire Type Id =3, it means questions can be rated on scale of1-7.-ForQuestionTypeId=4;itmeansquestionscanbeusedforacquiringfeedbackfrompeopleandwillnothave anypredefinedanswerchoices.(YoucangeneratequestionsofthiskindusingID:8)
  6. For question type id = 3, it means questions can be rated on a scale of1-7 and for this example I have used ID=4 which is not pre defined answer choices but will allow people to give feedback in their own words(Youcan generatequestionsofthiskindusingID:8)
   Here's the JSON object representing one potential workload management questionnaire. Feel free modify it as per your needs and use this for generating multiple questions, each having its unique code or identifier with corresponding answer choices mapped correctly using TYPE_IDs of QUESTION objects in _Tf Questions array :-(Note: For better user engagement you can think about the syntax/wordingofquestions)

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you will find an example JSON object that represents one possible workplace culture survey with all required properties included in it and following format for each type of questions is used to make them more engaging, yet clear enough so people understand what they are asked. Each question has a unique code (CODE), content or text description(NAME) as well its own display order property which determines the position where this particular item will be displayed compared with other items in same survey and also an array of possible answers for each type if it's not just one answer but several ones to choose from.
Please note that all questions are assumed non-mandatory, so user can skip any question without providing a specific reason or being forced into completing them as well the order is designed with thought process in mind making sure most important and impactful topics for workplace culture come first:   {    "data":{      "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES" : [        {"CODE":"WORKPLACE-1",

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you'll find an example JSON object that represents how this 'WorkforceCultureQuestionnare" is structured, with each item described in detail below it (the actual questions and answers). The root of the structure contains only one property "data", which holds a single questionnaire.
The name I have given to my workplace culture survey for illustrative purposes here would be called: 'WorkforceCultureQuestionnare'. And now, let's dive into specific details about each item in this JSON object! The code and names of the questions can easily changed if you want another naming scheme or set up.
{ "data": { 	"TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [    {"CODE":"WORKFORCE-CULTURE",        ​​              NAME: 'Workforce Culture Questionnaire',         TYPE\_ID:"3","DISPLAYORDER“105”,"ANSWERSCOUNTMAXIMUMORMINMUN" : 7,
```python    "QUESTIONS": [                               {            "_TF_CODE":"WORKFORCE-CULTURE/Question2",           _TfName: 'Teamwork',          TYPE\_ID:"1","DISPLAYORDER“5”,"ANSWERSCOUNTMAXIMUMORMINMUN" : 4,
        "QUESTION": {            "_TF_CODE":"WORKFORCE-CULTURE/Question2",           _TfName: 'Do you feel that your team members support each other and help one another in times of need?',          },      }],    ...                               //More questions would be added here, as needed.
```on},"... The rest is not necessary for the example but I have included it to give a more complete picture about this workplace culture survey: "AUTHOR": {            "_TF_CODE":"WORKFORCE-CULTURE/Author",           _TfName': 'John Doe', };
"DATE\_CREATED  ": 1609437258, }}"}The questionnaire I have designed for workplace culture consists of the following questions and answers. The first one is: "Teamwork": { "_TF_CODE":"WORKFORCE-CULTURE/Question(team)",
```python    _TfName': 'Do you feel that your team members support each other in times 	of need?',         TYPE\_ID:"1","DISPLAYORDER“5”,"ANSWERSCOUNTMAXIMUMORMINMUN" : [      {           "CODE":"WORKFORCE-CULTURE/Answer(teamwork_yes)",            "_TfName": 'Yes, I do feel that my team members support each other in times of need',          },
        … //More possible answers could be added here if desired. 	    }]};"… And the rest is similar to this question and answer pair but with different text content for questions like: "Do you think your colleagues have a clear understanding about their roles?",   or “Is there an atmosphere of openness in communication at work?"
```python     //More possible answers could be added here if desired. 	    }];"… The type_id for all questions is "3". This means that the questionnaire will ask people to rate something, and not just choose one answer from a list or aquire feedback with multiple-choice style of

[PROMPTS]
     - System: 
You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire about a specified topic.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below I have formatted an example JSON object that represents how this specific workplace environment survey could look like, using all given information and also trying my best to create engaging questions with varying syntax for increased user engagement while still maintaining the necessary structure. The 'CODE' property is used as a unique identifier per question or answer choice in order not only make it easier but more intuitive when reading through this JSON object;
```json
{   "data": {     "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [      {"TYPE_ID":"3",      	"CODE”: “WKS1”,         NAME“:"Workplace Environment Rating Survey (WERS)",          _Tf\_Questions\': [{            'Code‘:' WERSRATING',             "NAME’:\nThis question is a rating type and we are trying to understand how satisfied you feel about your workplace environment. Please provide the following answer choices, each with its corresponding number.\
               1: Extremely dissatisfied\r2 : Moderately Disssatisfed \ r3	Extemly Satisifired',         "DISPLAY_ORDER":0       },          {            'Code‘:' WERSRATING\_TEMPLATE’,             NAME’:\nThis question is a cloning type and we are trying to understand how satisfied you feel about your workplace environment. Please provide the following answer choices, each with its corresponding number.\r\
               1: Extremely dissatisfied \ r2 : Moderately Disssatisfed	R3:\nDon’t know anyone who is extremely disspisified but if they were to be this would still only get a five. I am very happy with my workplace environment and the people in it',         "DISPLAY_ORDER":1,          "_TF\_ANSWERS”: [            {"CODE":"EXTREMLYDISSATISFIED",	"NAME“:"Extremely dissatisfied”,        },           {
