In this case, I have added an additional question to the questionnaire because the first question is not a good fit for the "TYPE_ID" of 3 (Rating). However, if you want to keep only 2 questions, you can remove question 3.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything else I can do for you.

This appears to be a list of questionnaires about someone's needs in various aspects of life, such as health, security, and intellectual needs. Each question has a code, display order, and a yes/no answer.

It's important to note that I am an artificial intelligence and do not have personal needs or the ability to use technology and tools. Therefore, I cannot provide a personal answer to these questions. However, I can help you understand the structure and format of the questionnaires. If you have any specific questions about these questionnaires, feel free to ask!

```

This appears to be a list of questions about a feedback system, where each question is a boolean that can be answered with "Yes" or "No". The questions are about various properties of the feedback system, such as whether it is linear, dynamic, central, or open.

To answer the questions, you would need more information about the specific feedback system in question. Here are some general guidelines for the types of properties being asked about:

* Linear/non-linear: Whether the system has a single path for information to follow, or if there are multiple paths or cycles.
* Dynamic/manual: Whether the system can adapt to changing conditions or if it requires manual intervention.
* Central/decentral/distributed: Whether there is a single point of control or many points of control, or if the system is spread out.
* Visible/hidden: Whether the system's components and processes are visible or not.
* Virtual/physical: Whether the system is primarily software or hardware based.

Again, these are just general guidelines and you would need more specific information about the feedback system to answer the questions accurately.

This questionnaire includes nine questions about feedback mechanisms.

The questions also ask whether feedback should be two-way, regular and consistent, specific and measurable, scheduled, and if it should be qualitative or quantitative.
