This is a JSON representation of a questionnaire about internal mobility opportunities. Each question is represented as an object, with properties like "CODE", "NAME", "TYPE\_ID", and "DISPLAY\_ORDER" used to identify and order the questions. The "ANSWERS" for each question are also stored as a list of objects with an "ANSWER" property.

To convert this JSON representation into a format that can be used to ask the questions to participants, you would need to write a function that takes the JSON representation as input and outputs a list of question objects. Each question object would have a "TEXT" property (the question itself), "ANSWERS" property (a list of answer objects), and potentially other properties like "TYPE\_ID" and "DISPLAY\_ORDER".

Here is an example of how such a function might look:

```
function parseQuestionnaire(questionnaire) {
  // Write your code here
}
```

Write a function called `parseQuestionnaire` that takes a questionnaire JSON representation as input and returns a list of question objects. Each question object should have a "TEXT" property (the question itself), "ANSWERS" property (a list of answer objects), and potentially other properties like "TYPE\_ID" and "DISPLAY\_ORDER".

The first question in the JSON representation is:

"Do you agree that internal mobility opportunities are important for employee satisfaction and retention?"

And the answers for this question are:

* Strongly agree
* Agree
* Neutral
* Disagree
* Strongly disagree

The "TYPE\_ID" property is 2, and the "DISPLAY\_ORDER" is 1.

Here is the desired output for the first question:

```
{
  "TEXT": "Do you agree that internal mobility opportunities are important for employee satisfaction and retention?",
  "ANSWERS": [
    {
      "TEXT": "Strongly agree"
    },
    {
      "TEXT": "Agree"
    },
    {
      "TEXT": "Neutral"
    },
    {
      "TEXT": "Disagree"
    },
    {
      "TEXT": "Strongly disagree"
    },
    "TYPE\_ID": 2,
    "DISPLAY\_ORDER": 1
}
```

Please write a function called `parseQuestionnaire` that takes a questionnaire JSON representation as input and returns a list of question objects. The first question and its answers are provided as an example.

This is a JSON object that represents a questionnaire about work pressure. The questionnaire has 14 questions, each with a unique code and name, and a set of possible answers. The possible answers are:

* Strongly agree
* Somewhat agree
* Neutral
* Somewhat disagree
* Strongly disagree

Each question is a yes/no question, and the answer options represent the level of agreement with the statement. For example, question 1 asks if the person feels pressure to work longer hours than they would like, and the answer options are:

* Strongly agree
* Somewhat agree
* Neutral
* Somewhat disagree
* Strongly disagree

The other questions ask about feeling pressure to work on weekends, feeling pressure to work when sick, and so on. The questionnaire can be used to assess the level of work pressure experienced by a person.

The questionnaire on WorkLife Balance has 7 questions, but all of them are binary (Yes/No) or with a few options. This is because the questionnaire is intended to be a starting point for a conversation about work-life balance, and not a comprehensive evaluation. The questions are designed to encourage reflection and discussion about the topic, rather than providing a definitive answer.

 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:

            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
