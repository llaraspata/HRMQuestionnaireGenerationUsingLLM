```   That's a very long text, but I think it might be helpful to share that this person seems unhappy about something and mentions "feedback mechanism" or similar terms multiple times. It could mean they don't like the current feedback system in place at their job/school etc., OR feel unheard when giving suggestions for improvement!

Generate me a questionnaire on Feedback Mechanisms with 9 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this feedback mechanisms questionnaire is as follows - there are nine (10) different types of survey-style multiple choice and rating style questions, each having its own unique code. Each type also has a name that describes the purpose or function it serves in terms of gathering information about people's opinions on certain topics; these can be used to measure employee satisfaction with their work environment for example - as well as display order which determines where they appear within this questionnaire and an array containing all possible answers along side them.
The nine (10) questions are: 
- ID=5, NAME="How do you feel about the level of communication in your team?", TYPE_ID=7; _TF\_ANSWERS = [ "Very satisfied with current state","Somewhat content but think there is room for improvement","Neutral opinion - neither positive nor negative feeling towards this issue","Unhappy and dissatisfied, would like more open dialogue between colleagues"]
- ID="Q1", NAME='How often do you feel your ideas are heard in meetings?', TYPE_ID=3; _TF\_ANSWERS = [ "Always listened to by my peers when sharing thoughts","Most of the time I am given a chance for input, but sometimes overlooked or forgotten about it.", "Seldom have opportunity because others dominate conversation", "<strong>Never</strong>, not once has anyone ever let me speak during discussions"]
- ID="Q2", NAME='On scale from 1 to 5 how would you rate the level of collaboration within your team?', TYPE_ID=8; _TF\_ANSWERS = [ "Strongly agree that we work together seamlessly and effectively","Somewhat satisfied with current state but think there is room for improvement", "<strong>Neutral</strong>", "Disagreeable opinion, feel like I am not included in group activities or projects"]
- ID="Q3", NAME='Do you believe your team has a good balance of ideas and opinions?', TYPE_ID=4; _TF\_ANSWERS = [ "<strong>Strongly agree</strong>, everyone contributes equally, making it easy to find common ground","Somewhat disagreeable - think that some people dominate conversation while others are silenced", "Neutral opinion on this matter"]

 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.

Generate me a questionnaire on Leadership Effectiveness with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you will find an example JSON object that represents a survey for evaluating leadership effectiveness, consisting of seven multiple-choice typequestions and one set of possible answers perquestion (labeled 'ANSWER'). The code property is used to identify each question in the array.
The name field contains text content describing what information about being effective as leader should be provided by respondent for that particular questions; this may include a scale or other type-of response format, suchas Likert (strongly agree/disagree) and semantic differential(e.g., usefulness).
The display_order field is used to order the questionnaire in an appealing way while still maintaining its logical flow from one topic area another; this also allows for easy reordering if desired by user or administrator of survey system, without havingto manually adjust each item individually and potentially disrupting other parts. The typeId property indicates which kindof multiple-choice format is being used: 1 = single answer perquestion (radio buttons), while the rest are different types such as checkboxesand sliders with labels on them instead just one choice selected bydefault in this case because it's more engaging for participants who may not have strongopinions about all topics presented.
Please note that some questions might be repeated across surveys if they serve multiplepurposes, but each question will always contain a unique code and name combinationto ensure accurate tracking of data collected during administration process:

     - System: 
You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire specifying the topic and the number of questions.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

```python
This questionnaire has six questions and is designed to gather feedback on various aspects of a company's teambuilding initiatives. The first three items focus specifically on the favorability and impactfulness of these activities, while item four asks about communication within teams after participating in them. Each type_id value for this JSON object corresponds with an answer scale that can be used to interpret responses more easily:
1 = Likert-type questions (strongly agree/disagree) or 5 point rating scales; the higher, the better score received by a team building activity and its impact. The items are not interchangeable as they have been designed with specific display orders in mind to create an engaging experience for participants
