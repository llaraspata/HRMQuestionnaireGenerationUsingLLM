 Explanation: The structure I will use for this 'OnBoarding' Questionaire is as follows - there are six Questions in total, each having specific properties such that they meet certain conditions and fulfill the purpose of being an effective part within a questionnaire. Each property has been assigned values with careful consideration so it could cater to all types (1-8) mentioned above if required while also making sure user engagement is not compromised by keeping things simple yet interactive enough -

"TYPE\_ID":"3", // Type ID is set as ‚ÄòRate‚Äô for this question to get a rating out from the user and not just one answer but multiple. This will help in understanding how positive or negative their experience was, making it more interactive with different options rather than restricting them within only 1 option
"DISPLAY\_ORDER": "0", // Display order is set as ‚ÄòFirst‚Äô for this question to be displayed first out of all questions mentioned here and not any other. It can also vary depending on the requirement but keeping things simple yet effective, we will keep it at number one position in array list format below

 Explanation: The structure I will provide for this employee feed-back topic is as follows, where each element in 'data' array represents one specific type of format to give more information about the survey and its details (in JSON):<br/> <pre> { "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [ 	{    CODE: EMPLOYEEFEEDBACK123,
NAME : Employee Feedback Questionnaire Template for HR Manager - Type ID #046789 ,        TYPE\_ID   = > FEELING ABOUT THEIR JOB AND WORKPLACE ENV.,         _TF_QUESTIONS: [ 	 {    CODE               : Q1,

The name specified in NAME property will help identify it easily as well.<Br/  
TYPE\_ID = > ID04 , where Type Id #> <font size="6"> 3 </FONT>, is an integer value indicating that this survey requires open-ended, short and long text answers from participants. The second question in the _TF_QUESTIONS array has a type of 'rating' which indicates it will be evaluated based on scores given by respondents.<br/><BR />The property '_tf\_questions', is an object that contains all questions for this survey, and its value can also have any number as well. Each question in the _TF_QUESTIONS array has 4 properties: 'CODE' - a unique code to identify each specific item.<br/>NAME = > How do you feel about your manager?<BR />The name specified will help define what this particular survey is trying get out of participants, and it can be used as an identifier. The property TYPE\_ID has 6 different values in the JSON provided: ID01 - Single choice from a list.<br/>
TYPE_ID = > RATING<BR/  	 DISPLAY ORDER : <font size="5">2</FONT><Br />This is indicating that this question should be displayed as second item for participants to answer, and the order can vary based on need. The property '_tf\_answers' has a single value of ANSWER: 'How do you feel about your manager?' which represents one possible open-ended or short text response from any participant.<br/><BR />The same process is followed for all other questions, and I have provided 4 different types in the JSON format to give more variety. Please find below a questionnaire on Employee Feedback with four unique items:
```json { "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [    EMPLOYEEFEEDBACK123 = > NAME : 'Employeefeed- back Questionnaire Template for HR Manager - Type ID #046789', 	 _tfQuestions: [{

Generate me a questionnaire on Training effectiveness with 2 questions

-------------------

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I have created for this training evaluation survey is as follows - there are two main categories, namely 'data' and '_TF_QUESTIONS'. Within these properties you will find the code of each individual piece. For example within data property it has a single element with name "Training effectiveness" which includes an array named "_TFRATINGS". This is then broken down into 2 questions in this instance, but can be expanded to cater for more if needed by adding further elements and properties as required

Generate me a questionnaire on Career path with 10 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I have chosen for this career-path focused, ten item long Questionaire is as follows - A single JSON object containing one property 'data' which in turn contains another Property called "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES" that holds an array of questionnaires. Each element (Questionnaire) inside the TF\_ QUESTATIONAIRE Array has several properties such
- CODE: Unique identifier for each Questionaire, ex - CP105678GHJKL or something like this in string format; NAME : The name of that questionairre. It can be anything related to the topic and informative about what is being asked through it such as "Career Path" here ; TYPE\_ID: Int value which will remain 3 for all Questionnaire types,
- _TF_QUESTIONS Array containing multiple Objects of Questions in that particular questionairre. Each object has several properties like CODE : Unique identifier string format similar to the one we used with QUIZ ABOUT YOU but this time specific and unique; NAME: The actual Question content, TYPE\_ID (int) This value will vary depending on whether it is Multiple Choice or Single choice etc.
- _TF_ANSWERS Array containing multiple Objects of answers in that particular question if there are any available for a given QUESTION otherwise null and the ANSR Property which contains actual answer string format; DISPLAY\_ORDER Int value to order questions based on this number from 1st one, second two etc.
- In addition I have added some properties like MULTIPLE_CHOICE or SINGEL CHOIcE with boolean values True and False respectively if that question is multiple choice true otherwise false; LONG\_DESCRIPTION : A detailed explanation of the Question in string format to make it more interactive for users.
- And a property called "SUGGESTED_ANSWERS" which contains array object having max 4 items with their codes and names as properties, This will help user by suggesting them correct code while answering questions if they want; I have also used different type of answers to make it more interactive for example N/A or Not Applicable etc.
- And finally a property called "IS\_REQUIRED" which is boolean value true false respectively indicating that the question should be answered and not left blank otherwise, This will help user by suggesting them correct code while answering questions if they want; I have also used different type of answers to make it more interactive for example N/A or Not Applicable etc.
Below you can find JSON formatted Questionnaire on Career path with 10 Questions - Please note that all the above mentioned properties are not necessarily needed in every question and some questions might be missing few things but I have tried my best to make it more interactive for users by using different type of answers, suggestions etc.

 Explanation: The structure I will use for this learner's post-course evaluation is as follows - there are eight main categories, each containing one or more prompts to elicit specific information. Each prompt has an associated answer type (either single select option / multiple selections allowed).
Questions about course content and material: 1) "How would you rate the overall quality of this year's learning materials?" with a five-star scale for answers, where one star means very poor; two to three stars indicate average or mixed feelings towards it while four starts mean good but not excellent. Five Stars represent an outstanding course content experience in your opinion.; 2) "Which specific topic(s)/learning material do you think needs improvement?" - This question allows learners' detailed feedback on particular topics that may have been problematic, and they can select multiple options if necessary;
Questions about the format of delivery: a). Teaching methodology ‚Äì Is there anything special/unique regarding this course?

If not specifically then what improvements would make it more applicable. b) Suggested Changes - What changes or additions do you think should be included to enhance its effectiveness and applicability for future learners?.
Questions about course impact: a). Personal Impact of Course ‚Äì How has this session affected your life personally? Please share any anecdotes if possible, as it will help us understand the value derived from attending. b) Recommendation - Would you recommend others to attend same/similar sessions based on what was learned here?.
Questions about course satisfaction: a). Course Satisfaction ‚Äì Were your needs met satisfactorily during this session? Please specify areas where improvement is needed and those that were perfect, so we can continue delivering high-quality learning experiences. b) Comparison with Previous Sessions - How does it compare to previous sessions you have attended in terms of quality & impact?. Rate them on scale 1: not satisfied at all; two ‚Äì somewhat dissatisfied but willingness for improvement is there till four stars, which means completely content and five starts that represent a highly satisfactory experience.

[PROMPTS]
     - System: 
You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire specifying the topic and the number of questions.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will follow for creating this JSON object is as follows - there are several properties under 'data' which itself exists within an outermost curly brackets (indicating that it‚Äôs indeed the root of our questionnaire). Within data, we have a property called "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES" and its value will be another array.
This particular element in this TF\_ QUES TONAIRE Sarray is an object containing several properties - CODE (string), NAME(String) which should indicate it‚Äôs technology access questionnaire, TYPE ID as 3 because we are creating a rating type of questions and lastly the _TF_QUESTIONS array.
Within this "_ TF QUES TONAIRE Sarray", there will be only nine objects - representing each individual query/question in our Access to Technology & Tools questionnaire, with their respective properties: CODE(string), NAME (String) which should indicate the content of every specific questions and its DISPLAY ORDER.
Within these 9 elements inside "_ TF_QUESTIONS" array there will be no property called 'ANSWERS' because we want to get user engagement by using creative syntax for all our queries/questions - this means that each question is inherently an object with multiple properties and not just a simple string.
Now, let us see the JSON format of Accessibility Questionnaire:  <br> {<hr size="1">"data":{    "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES ":[        {"CODE":"AT02","NAME‚Äù:"Do you feel that technology makes it easier for people to connect with each other?",‚ÄúTYPE\_ID ‚Äù3,‚ÄùDISPLAY ORDER ‚Äú: 9},{" CODE ‚ÄûTECHNOLOGY MAKES IT EAS IER FOR PEOPLE TO CONNECT WITH OTHERS THROUGH TE CHN0LG Y AND FACILITIES?","NAME":"Do you think technology makes it easier for people to connect with each other through communication facilities and channels?","TYPE\_ID":3,‚ÄùDISPLAY ORDER‚Äù:1},{" CODE ":‚ÄúCAN YOU EAS ILY UNDERSTAND OTHERS‚Äô POINT OF VIEW WHEN THEIR COMMUNICATION IS THROUGH TECHNOLOGICAL MEDIUMS?","NAME":"Can you easily understand others' point of view when their communication is through technological mediums?","TYPE\_ID":3,‚ÄùDISPLAY ORDER‚Äù:2},{" CODE ":‚ÄúIS IT EASY FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCESS TECHNOLOGICAL INFORMATION WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE?‚Äù,"NAME":"Is it easy for you to understand and access technological information without any assistance?","TYPE\_ID":3,‚ÄùDISPLAY ORDER‚Äù:1},{" CODE ":‚ÄúDOES THE AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES MAK ES IT EASIER FOR YOU PERSONALLY?‚Äù,"NAME":"Does the availability of certain tools and technologies make it easier for you personally?","TYPE\_ID":3,‚ÄùDISPLAY ORDER‚Äù:1},{" CODE ":‚ÄúARE THE INTERNET ACCESS AND CONNECTIVITY SUFFICIENTLY AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO PERFORM YOUR WORK?‚Äù,"NAME":"Are the internet access and connectivity sufficiently available for you to perform your work?","TYPE\_ID":3,‚ÄùDISPLAY ORDER‚Äù:1},{" CODE ":‚ÄúDOES THE DESIGN AND INTERFACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL PRODUCTS MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO USE?‚Äù,"NAME":"Does the design and interface of technological products make it easier for you to use?","TYPE\_ID":3,‚ÄùDISPLAY ORDER‚Äù:1},{" CODE ":‚ÄúDOES THE AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES AND PLATFORMS MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO LEARN?‚Äù,"NAME":"Does the availability of certain technologies and platforms make it easier for you to learn?","TYPE\_ID":3,‚ÄùDISPLAY ORDER‚Äù:1},{" CODE ":‚ÄúDOES THE AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES AND PLATFORMS MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO COMMUNICATE?‚Äù,"NAME":"Does the availability of certain technologies and platforms make it easier for you to communicate?","TYPE\_ID":3,‚ÄùDISPLAY ORDER‚Äù:1}    ]  }<hr size="4">
It‚Äôs important that all questions are rated on a scale from one (strongly disagree) through five(neutral), up-to ten - strongly agree.

Generate me a questionnaire on Career development with 14 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I have chosen for this career-development themed JSON is as follows - there will be an array called 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' which contains one object representing the single required Questionaire. Within that questionnaire, we can find a few things such
as NAME and TYPE\_ID (both strings), CODE ('3'), _ TF \_\Questions', another Array containing 14 objects - our target number of questions! Each individual Object in this array will represent one particular career-development related Question. For each question, there are certain properties like 'CODE' for the unique identifier and NAME to hold its content (both strings), TYPE\_ID describing what type it is(integer) ,DISPLAY ORDER defining order of displaying questions among all 14 Questions in this array - an integer value
Also included within each question will be '_TF_ANSWERS' as another Array containing maximum five objects for multiple choice or rating based answers and single object if answer type doesn‚Äôt require it. Each individual Object here has a property named ' AN SWER', which is the content of that particular Answer - also string
I have tried to make questions engaging, informative but not overly intrusive by using conversational tone! I hope this achieves desired effect :) Let me know if you would like any changes or clarifications. Here it goes:<br><pre> { "data":{"TF_QUESTIONNARES" : [

     - System: 
You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire specifying the topic and the number of questions.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

Generate me a questionnaire on Internal Mobility Opportunities with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: Below you will find an example JSON format for generating 'INTERNAL_MOBILITY' topic in Human Resource Management field, containing seven (multi-type)questions and their respective answers. The data array contains a single property called TF\_QUESTIONNAIRES which includes the following information about each questionnaire:
CODE - unique code of that specific survey or form; NAME ‚Äì name/title given to this particular set in order for it be easily identified by users, TYPE_ID- type identifier. Here we have chosen a mix and match types like 3 (rating),5(reordering) &6-(distributing weights across several items).
Please note that each question has its own code as well to make sure no two questions are the same within one survey or form, also for easy reference in case of any changes. Each answer object contains a string representing content only and not an integer value because this is meant just like template with specific strings already pre-filled by client but user can still change it if desired:

[TEST] QUESTIONNAIRE_ID: 500100027
     - Topic: Job Satisfaction
     - Question number: 17
-------------------
[PROMPTS]
     - System: 
You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire specifying the topic and the number of questions.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

Generate me a questionnaire on Job Satisfaction with 17 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I am using for this job satisfaction survey is as follows - there are seventeen 'questions' in total, each represented within '_TF_QUESTIONS'. Each of these objects has the following properties (the values below would be used to populate those fields):
- CODE ('JOB1', ... , or another unique identifier) ‚úÖ‚ùóÔ∏èüîå - NAME <string> The content/text for each question. This is what a participant will see and respond with, so it's important that this text makes sense in order to get useful data!
- TYPE_ID (integer between [1..8]) ‚úÖ‚ùóÔ∏èüîå - DISPLAY\_ORDER <int> The display sequence for each question. I have kept the same as a way of ensuring questions are not displayed out or contextually disconnected from one another, but this can be changed if required!
- _TF_ANSWERS An array containing at least four 'answers' (these would vary depending on whether it is an ID 1/2 question type). Each answer object has a single property ANSWR <string> - the content of each option. I have used this to create different answers and provided some with more than one possible response, so that participants can select multiple options if they wish!
Here's how it would look in JSON format: üîå‚ùóÔ∏è‚úÖ{ "data": { 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES': [    <snip>      ,    17 other questions...   ] } };<span style="color : rgb(0,254

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this JSON is as follows - there are several nested objects and arrays, but they all represent different parts of one object (the 'data' property) which contains an array. This makes the code more readable in my opinion than having a flat list with no hierarchy or context to each element:
```jsonline {    "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [        {"CODE":"KICKOFFMEETINGFEEDBACK",            NAME" Kick-off Meeting Feedback Questionnaire 7 Questions Version1.0","TYPEID3,                 "_TFTOPICSTEMPLATEFORCEODEVELOPMENTTEAMSBUILDERSANDPLANNers": [               {"CODE":"TOPICTECHNOLOGY",          NAME"Technology used in the kick-off meeting?

Generate me a questionnaire on Leadership Effectiveness with 6 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this 'LeaderShip EffecTiveness' (LET) QuestionnAire is as follows - there are six questIons in total, and all of them have the same format. They each include a code to identify it uniquely; name or description that briefly explains what should be answered about leadership effectiveness for this particular question ('typeId', 'displayOrder' don‚Äôt need explanation here); then an array called '_TF_ANSWERS'. This final property has as many objects/answers in the same format - each answer object contains a single string value: ANSwer.
I have tried to make it more engaging by using different phrases and sentence structures, but I will keep you engaged with my explanations too! Let's get started... :) Questionnaire is structured as JSON below; please enjoy reading through this LET questionnAire - let me know if anything needs further explanation or adaptation:

Generate me a questionnaire on Leadership Effectiveness with 7 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: This JSON object represents one leadership effectiveness evaluation survey, which contains seven multiple-choice rating type (TYPE_ID =3)questions and each has four possible answers for respondents to choose from when answering. The display order of the question is also included in this format so that it can be used as a reference during creation but not necessary while using later on because we will use UUIDs instead:
```json
{    "data": {        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [            {"CODE":"LEADERSHIP1","NAME":"Leadership Effectiveness - 04/26 (Tue) AM-3.58PM UTC",     	"TYPE_ID":  7,
               _TTF questions array and each question object has the following properties:    "DISPLAY ORDER ": Number value for display order of this particular multiple choice rating type Question in a survey or test form (these are not necessary to be unique). If you use them it will help with sorting sequence. But while using later on during data collection, please do NOT rely only upon these values and always double check that the questions get collected IN THE SAME ORDER as they were designed/stored in your system! 
               _TTF ANSWERS array for this multiple choice rating type question object has following properties:    "AN SWER": String value representing a particular answer to be given when using Question Code. If you use the same set of Answers across all questions then it is very easy and convenient because once can reuse Answer objects, just make sure that answers get collected back in THE SAME ORDER as they were designed/stored!
               "CODE": String value representing a unique code for this particular Question. This MUST be UNIQUE within your system to avoid any confusion or conflicts when collecting data from multiple sources into the same database,   	"NAME ":  The actual text of each question is stored in NAME property as string and it should not contain semicolon ";",
               "TYPE_ID": Integer value representing a type identifier for this particular Question. In our case we will use only three values: ID =1 (Single choice),  	      2(Multiple Choice) or 3=Rating,    }        ]}}```The questionnaire is as follows in JSON format with display order and unique code included to help you better understand how it can be used but not necessary for your system.

Generate me a questionnaire on Onboarding Experience with 7 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this 'OnBoarding Questionniare' is as follows - there are seven different sections (questions) in it, each represented under the '_TF_QUESTIONS‚Äô property of an object. Each section has a unique code and name that describes what type/format question they represent; their display order on screen or preference can also be set using 'DISPLAY ORDER' attribute - for example if you want to make this survey look more like conversation then first questions should have lower number than the later ones in terms of DISPLAT_ORDER. And finally, each section has a list (array) that includes all possible answers and their code under '_TF\_ANSWERS‚Äô property; these codes can be used for analysis purposes or even to calculate scores based on provided set values if needed!
```json {    "data":{        "_TFS_QUESTIONNAIRES" : [            {"CODE":"ONB1","NAME":"OnBoarding Experience - Questionnaire 06-25",     	   ‚ÄúTYPE\_ID‚Äù:3,          _"TF QUES T I ONS ":[                    {               "ANSWER":{"TEXT‚Äú:"Please rate your onboarding experience with our company based upon this statement ‚ÄòI felt welcome and well informed during my first week‚Äò","CODE":"Q01"},           	     ‚ÄúNAME‚Äù:<strong>Question 6</br></span><p style="font-size :24px" >During the entirety of your onboarding process, you were provided with all necessary information to feel confident and prepared for performing tasks.</P>",

Generate me a questionnaire on Quality of Diversity Training Programs with 7 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this quality assessment is as follows - there are seven categories that need their own code, name and type ID (as they all have the same purpose). There can be multiple-choice or single answer options within these sections. Each question has a unique display order to ensure it appears in sequence after being sent out:
```json {    "data":{        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES" : [            {"CODE":"DT01",                    	                'NAME':'Quality of Diversiety Training Programs - Part I',         ‚ÄúTYPE\_ID‚ÄùÔºö3,          ‚ÄùDISPLAY ORDER‚Äú:7},
             "FIRST Q":{              ‚ÄòQUESTION‚Äô:"How would you rate the following diversity training program?",          	            'CODE':'DT01.P2S‚Äô,                     ‚ÄôANSWERS‚Äò : [{"VALUE":"Very Good"}, {"Value"Ôºö""Good"}Ôºå  {‚ÄúAnswer‚Äù: "Average","TYPE\_ID":3},

I will now generate six more questions in a similar format for you:

You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire specifying the topic and the number of questions.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

Generate me a questionnaire on Recognition and Rewards with 8 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use is as follows - there are eight different types, or categories if you prefer of recognition-related statements that an employee can agree (or disagree) to varying degrees. Each statement has a code for internal tracking purposes ('CODE') and the text itself which includes spaces so it reads better than just being in all caps with no punctuation at end 'NAME'. The type id is 8 because I am using this format of question, but any other number can be used if you want to use another style. Each statement also has a display order ('DISPLAY_ORDER') which determines the sequence they appear and whether there are multiple choice options for answers or just one answer as it does not make sense in certain contexts (either through '_TF\_ANSWERS' array of objects with 'TYPE ID = 1,2', OR if only a single option is to be allowed then that will simply exist without being inside an object).

 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.

Generate me a questionnaire on Workload Management with 6 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The following JSON object represents an assessment for work-life balance, which is often referred as "Workplace Burnout Assessment". It has five sections and each section contains one or more multiple choice type ofquestions. Each possible answer in the "_TF_ANSWERS" array also have a name associated with it to make answers easier understandable by humans rather than just using IDs for different options, which is common practice when storing assessment data as JSON object:
```json
{  "data": {    "__type": ["HRBURNT", "", {}, {}],      "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES ": [        {"CODE":"1023647589","NAME" : "[WORKPLACE BURNOUT ASSESSMENT] - SECTION 	extttt: WORK ENVIRONMTENT",    "TYPE _ID":

Generate me a questionnaire on Workload Management with 7 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this work is an object that contains only one property 'data'. This data has also another single element, which represents my JSON Questionaire format and the name of it in our case would be "WorkLoadManagement". It's a type 3 questionnaire with questions related to Workload Management.
I will create seven Questions for you on this topic: The first one is about numberOfScreens; Second- HowManyHoursDoYouStudy, third - WhatIsYourPreferredLearningStyle and fourth ‚Äì IsThereSuchThingAsWorkLifeBalanceInThisDigitalAge question. Fifth would be a rating type of questions asking to rate the level OfStress they feel with this workload management system; Sixth- IfTheyCouldChangeSomethingAboutTheirCurrentJob what it is, And finally seventh - HowOftenDoYouTakeBreaksFromWork and from which methods?
I am also adding some other properties for you: displayOrder of each question to make them appear in the same order as I wrote here. 7 questions are not too many but should be enough so user can give good feedback about Workload Management system they use, with all details needed like type and code IDs set properly according their types

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The JSON object I will generate is structured as follows - there's an outer 'data', containing one property, which in turn contains another array of objects representing each individual survey and its properties like code (string), name(String) type_id etc. Each questionnaire has a '_TF\_QUESTIONS‚Äô attribute that includes the questions with their specific codes as well._tf-answers' for potential answers to those who take it, which is also an array of objects containing 'ANSWER'.
For this Workplace Culture topic I have selected 7 different and interesting question types: - ID3 (rating), one selection from a list (-ID1) type_id=2). The questions are designed in various ways to engage the user. Here's your requested JSON object for workplace culture with seven engaging, thought-provoking prompts!

 Explanation: The structure I am using for this workplace culture topic is as follows - there will be seven individual items in 'questions' array, each representing one single item and its details like code (unique), name of the actual content or question are present.

Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Culture with 8 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: I will structure this JSON according to specifications you have given, but also try my best and make it more engaging for users filling out survey instead of just being purely factual; injecting personality into the content. Also trying not duplicate same question twice as that could be interpreted differently by different people if they see similar questions multiple times in a row so I am adding some randomness while keeping topic on Workplace Culture and generating 8 total prompts with following structure:
```json
{ "data": {    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES" : [        {"CODE":"WC01",            NAME:"WorkPlaceCultureQuestionsetOneReverseChronologicalOrderFirstQuestionIsLastAndViceVersaToKeepUserEngagedDontWorryAboutItJustDoingThisForFun! :)
             And now let's get started with question number one... Do you feel like your workplace is a positive environment where people can be themselves?",            "TYPE_ID":3,                    "_TF_QUESTIONS" : [{"CODE":"WC01.PCEPLACEMENT","NAME

 Explanation: The JSON structure for this workplace environment survey consists only out an array called 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'. This means that there is one single object, which represents the whole topic and all details about it. In our case we have a questionnaire on "Workplace Environment".
The specific properties of each questions are: CODE - unique code for every answer; NAME ‚Äì content or text displayed to user as an option in this survey type 3 (rating); DISPLAY_ORDER- order number that shows the sequence and positioning. The 'TYPE\_ID' is equal only with value "6" because we have selected a distribution of weights across several items/options for all questions, which represents our questionnaire on workplace environment topic:
{    ‚Äúdata‚Äù : {        "_TF_QUESTIONS": [            {"CODE":"WORKPLACE1","NAME‚Äú:"In your opinion how would you rate the level and quality in terms...",                "TYPE\_ID"=6,                   _"DISPLAYORDER‚Äû;2,"ANSWERS':[{" AN SWER ":5"},{    ‚ÄúAnswer":4},      {       ‚Äùanswer‚Äù:3     },

Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Environment with 7 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 Explanation: The structure I will use for this workplace environment survey is as follows - there are seven different topics that make up our 'questions' array, each represented in an object and containing the following properties necessary to describe it. Each topic has a unique code (CODE), content or question text displayed on screen ('NAME'), type of answer expected from user with IDs corresponding directly 1-6 as described above under QUESTION_TYPES section - this is not necessarily used but gives more flexibility if another system needs the data, and then 'DISPLAY\_ORDER' which will allow us to order questions in a specific way for better UX.
Another array of objects (_TF\_{PICKER} or _TFSINGLE) exists within each question representing different answer choices - this is optional but if included also contains the ANSWERS as strings and not IDs unless using another system that requires them, in which case you can use 1-5 to represent STRONGLY\_AGREE etc.
The seven topics I have chosen are: 'OPENNESS', describing how open a person'is towards new experiences; this question type is rated out of five (TYPE=3) and displayed using an ordered list for better UX design, with display order 1-5 in sequence from strongest agreement to disagreement.
Next comes the topic on whether someone feels comfortable at work or not - again a simple yes/no choice but presented as three options so user can select 'NEUTRAL' if they wish (TYPE=2) and displayed using an ordered list for better UX design, with display order 1-3 in sequence from strongly agree to disagree.
Next up is the topic of office temperature - this time allowing users more granularity by providing them six options ranging between 'TOO\_COLD' through a neutral option (TYPE=6) and displayed using an ordered list for better UX design, with display order 1-5 in sequence from strongly agree to disagree.
Then we move onto QUIETNESS - do people feel comfortable speaking up about issues they perceive as important? Again allowing users more granularity by providing them six options ranging between 'TOO\_LOUD' through a neutral option (TYPE=6) and displayed using an ordered list for better UX design, with display order 1-5 in sequence from strongly agree to disagree.
Next is LIGHT - how well lit does someone feel their environment should be? Again allowing users more granularity by providing them six options ranging between 'TOO\_DARK' through a neutral option (TYPE=6) and displayed using an ordered list for better UX design, with display order 1-5 in sequence from strongly agree to disagree.
Next we consider whether the person is able easily understand other people at work or not - again allowing users more granularity by providing them six options ranging between 'DIFFICULT\_TOO' through a neutral option (TYPE=6) and displayed using an ordered list for better UX design, with display order 1-5 in sequence from strongly agree to disagree.
Finally we consider the topic of how much someone enjoys their current role - again allowing users more granularity by providing them six options ranging between 'VERY\_MUCH' through a neutral option (TYPE=6) and displayed using an ordered list for better UX design, with display order 1-5 in sequence from strongly agree to disagree.
