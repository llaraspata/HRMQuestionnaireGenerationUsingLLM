The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire about a specified topic.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

                 },
               {ANSWER: "I have the right amount of work to do."},

               {ANSWER: ""},
                  {"Not Sure"}
             ]
}
```

Here's how I've structured this JSON-based Questionnaire:

1. The root of my questionnaire contains a single property 'data'.
2. This data object has one and only 7 questions.
3 Each question is represented by an array element in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' field, which itself resides within another level called "CODE" for each individual's unique code.

I hope this helps!

 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.

[LLM ANSWER]
Explanation:

Here's an example JSON for generating questionnaires. The root object contains 'data' property, which is another object that holds one and only element of type TF_QUESTIONNAIRES.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "_TF_QUESTIONSARES":[{
      "CODE":"EMPLOYEE_POTENTIAL",
        "NAME":"",
          "TYPE_ID" :3,
            '_TF_QUESSTION':[
              {"code":"","name","type_id",1,"display_order,0,'answers':
                [
                  {'answer':'Highly Potential'},
                   {{"Low"}
                 ]
               },
             {
       }
     }]
}

Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.

Explanation: Here's how I structured this JSON-formatted questionnaire:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
            [
                {
                    "CODE":"ACCESS_TO_TECHNOLOGY",
                    "NAME":"",
                    "_TF_QUESTIONS":[],
                    
                 }

Here's how I structured this JSON-formatted Questionnaire Generator output for you. The root object contains one property 'data', which has another single-property named "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES". This array of questionnaires only includes the specified topic, in your case - a Leadership Effectiveness questionnaire.

          "NAME":"Leadership Style Assessment",  
          "_TYPE_ID_"   :"3"
         ,"_QUESTIONS_:":[{
            CODE: 'Q1',
           NAME:'What is your primary leadership style?',
             TYPE_'ID'  :'2'
              _ANSWERS_[{
                ANSWER : 'Transformational Leadership'},
               {

```json
{
  "data": {
    "_TF_QUESTNAIRES":

        { 
          "CODE":"ONB001",

          "TYPE_ID":3,
          "_TF_QUESIONS":[

Generate me a questionnaire on Recognition and Rewards

[LLM ANSWER]
Explanation:

Here's how I structured this JSON-based Questionnaire for you:
```
{
  "data": {
    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
      [
        {
          "CODE":"RR",

           TYPE_ID:3,
         _TF_QUESTIONS":[...]
       }
     ]
   }

Questionaire Structure:

1. The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
2. In this data, there's another level with '_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' which has one element.
```

Here it goes:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "_TF QUESTIONNAIR ES":
      [
        {
          "CODE":"RR",
         NAME"Recognition and Rewards Questionnaire", 
           TYPE_ID:3,
            _T F_QUESTIONS":[...]
       }
     ]
   }

Questionaire Content:

1. The first question is about the importance of recognition.
2. Next, we have a series questions that ask for opinions on different types
    *  Of Recognition and Rewards (e.g., public acknowledgement vs private 
      feedback).
3. Then there are some open-ended text fields to gather more information from respondents.

Here's how it looks in JSON format:
```json

{
"data": {
"TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
[
{"CODE":"RR",
 "NAME":"",
  TYPE_ID:1,
   _T F_QUESTIONS":[
    {" CODE ":"Q001"," NAME ":"
What do you think is the most important aspect of recognition and rewards? 
",TYPE ID :3,DISPLAY ORDER":0,"TF_ANSWERS":
[
{"ANSWER":"Public Acknowledgement"},
{ " ANSWER" :"Private Feedback"}
]
},
{
  {CODE: Q002,
   Name:"Do public recognitions have a positive impact on employees' morale?",
    TYPE_ID:1
     TF_QUESTIONS":[...]}
```

Explanation:

Here's how I structured this JSON-based Questionnaire for you:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
      [
        {
          "CODE":"WL001",
          "NAME":"",
           TYPE_ID:3,
            _tf_questions:[
              {"code":"","name","How would rate your current workload?"},
               ["_answers":[{"answer"="1 - Too High"},{"{"2- Manageable"}},{"{0.5}"]}],
             {
                code:"",
                 name:"Do you feel overwhelmed by the amount of work assigned to you?",
                  type:4,
                   _tf_answers:[ {"answe":"Strongly Agree"}, { "Agree", },  ]
              },
            ...
```
The questionnaire is structured as follows:

1. The root object contains a single property 'data'.
2. Within this data, there's an array of questionnaires with the key '_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'. In our case we have only one.
3. This main Questionnaire has properties: CODE (unique code), NAME(name given to questionnaire) and TYPE_ID which is equal 1 for Workload Management.

4.'_tf_questions' represents a list where each item in this array corresponds with an individual question within the survey, including its unique identifier 'code', content ('name'), type ID(6-8 representing different types of questions), display order('display_order') and possible answers('_TF_ANSWERS').

Explanation:

Here's how I've structured this JSON-based Questionnaire for you:
```
{
  "data": {
    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
      [
        {
          "CODE":"WPCULTURE",
          "NAME":"",
          "TYPE_ID":3,
           _tf_questions:[
             {"code":"","name","How would rate the overall work environment in your department?",type:1,display_order,"",answers:[{"answer"}]},
            ]
         }
       ]

}
```

Here's a sample questionnaire on Workplace Culture:

```json
{
  "data":
    {
      "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES": [
        {

          // Questionnaire Code and Name

           CODE:"WPCULTURE",
           NAME: "Workplace Culture Survey",

          TYPE_ID :3,

            _tf_questions:[
              {"code":"Q1","name":"","How would you rate the overall work environment in your department?"},
               {
                 code:"",
                name,"What do think is most important for a positive workplace culture?",
                  type,
                   2,answers:[]},
             ]
           }
         ]

}
```

Here's how I've structured this JSON-based Questionnaire:

1. The root of the questionnaire object contains only one property 'data'.
   - This data has two properties:
     * '_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array that holds a single element, which represents our Workplace Culture Survey.
       It includes information about code and name for your survey.

2. Each question in this JSON-based Questionnaire follows the same structure:

    1- The 'CODE': (string) - This property contains each individual's unique ID or any other identifier you may want to use within a questionnaire, such as "Q3" etc.
      *   It is used for identifying specific questions.

2. Each question also includes these properties:
     • '_NAME' : string: The content of the survey (e.g., 'How would rate your overall job satisfaction?').
       - This property represents each individual's unique ID or any other identifier you may want to use within a questionnaire, such as "Q3" etc.
         It is used for identifying specific questions.

     • '_TYPE_ID' : int: The type of question (e.g., 1-8).
        *   Each possible answer in this JSON-based Questionnaire has the following properties:
          - 'CODE': string
            This property contains each individual's unique ID or any other identifier you may want to use within a questionnaire, such as "Q3" etc.
              It is used for identifying specific questions.

     • '_DISPLAY_ORDER' : int: The display order of your question (e.g., 1-10).
        *   Each possible answer in this JSON-based Questionnaire has the following properties:
          - 'CODE': string
            This property contains each individual's unique ID or any other identifier you may want to use within a questionnaire, such as "Q3" etc.
              It is used for identifying specific questions.

     • '_TF_ANSWERS' : array: An object representing possible answers (e.g., 1-5).
        *   Each answer in this JSON-based Questionnaire has the following properties:
          - 'ANSWER': string
            This property contains each individual's unique ID or any other identifier you may want to use within a questionnaire, such as "Q3" etc.
              It is used for identifying specific questions.

I hope that helps!
