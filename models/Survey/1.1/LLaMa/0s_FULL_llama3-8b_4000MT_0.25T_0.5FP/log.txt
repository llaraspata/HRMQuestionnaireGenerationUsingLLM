        "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
            [
                {

```json

                {

                    '__TYPE_ID__':
                        3,
                    
                    '_QUESTIONS':
                            [   
                                {

     - System: 
You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire specifying the topic and the number of questions.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.

Explanation: Here's how I structured this JSON:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
            [
                {
                    "CODE":"ACCESS_TO_TECHNOLOGY",
                    "NAME":"",
                    "TYPE_ID":3,
                    "_TF_QUESTIONS":[],
                    
}
```

The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire specifying the topic and the number of questions.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.

Explanation: Here's how I structured this JSON:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
            [
                {

{
    "data": {
        "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
            [
                {
                    "CODE":"CPCLARITY",

                    "_TF_QUESTIONS":[],
                    
}
```

Here is the questionnaire on Career Path Clarity with 9 questions:
```JSON

"DATA":{
   'TP QUESTIONNARES':
      [ 
         {  
           CODE: CPCLRRT,

Explanation: Here's how I structured this JSON:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
            [
                {
                    "CODE":"JS_001",
                    "NAME":"",
                    "TYPE_ID":3,
                    "* _ TF QUESTIONS" : 
                        [   
                            {" CODE ":" JSQ1",  NAME: "", TYPE_ID:"2"},
                            {   ... }, // and so on
                        ]

Explanation: Here's how I structured this JSON:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
            [
                {
                    "CODE":"SATISFACTION",
                    "NAME":"",
                    "_TF_QUESTIONS":[],
                    
                }
                
            ]
        
}
```

Here is the generated questionnaire on Satisfaction with 5 questions:
```JSON

     - System: 
You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire specifying the topic and the number of questions.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

     - User: 
Generate me a questionnaire on Workload Management with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
Explanation: 

Here's how I've structured this JSON:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
            [
                {
                    "CODE":"WL001",
                    "NAME":"",
                    "_TF_QUESTIONS":[],
                    
                 }
             ]
}
```

Now, let me fill in the questionnaire with 7 questions on Workload Management:

```json
{
    "data": 
        {  
           "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
               [
                   {
                       "CODE":"WL001",
                      "NAME":"",
                     "_TF_QUESTIONS":[],
                    
                    }
                 ]
                } 

```

Here are the seven work-related questions, each with its own type and answer options:

```json
{
    "data": 
        {  
           "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
               [
                   {
                       "CODE":"WL001",
                      "NAME":"",
                     "_TF_QUESTIONS":[],
                    
                    }
                 ]
                } 

```

1. How often do you feel overwhelmed by your workload?

   - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION
     _tf_answers_: ["Never", 
                  "Rarely (less than once a month)",  
                   "Sometimes",
                      "Often"]

```json

{
    "_TF_QUESTIONS": [
        {
            "CODE":"WL001Q1-01",
           "NAME":"",
          TYPE_ID: 2,
         DISPLAY_ORDER:"",
       _tf_answers_: ["Never", 
                  "Rarely (less than once a month)",  
                   "Sometimes","Often"]
      }
    ]
}
```

The second question is about the impact of workload on your job satisfaction:

            CODE":"WL001Q1-01",
           NAME:"",
          TYPE_ID: 2,
         DISPLAY_ORDER:"0.5", 
       _tf_answers_: ["Not at all satisfied","Somewhat dissatisfied"
                  "Neutral (neither happy nor unhappy)"
                   "Slightly more than neutral"]
      }
    ]
}
```

The third question is about the time spent on tasks:

            CODE":"WL001Q1-01",
           NAME:"",
          TYPE_ID: 2,
         DISPLAY_ORDER:"0.5", 
       _tf_answers_: ["Less than an hour","Between one and two hours"
                  "More than three"]
      }
    ]
}
```

The fourth question is about the workload distribution:

```json
{
   "_TF_QUESTIONS": [
        {
            CODE":"WL001Q1-01",
           NAME:"",

         DISPLAY_ORDER:"0.5", 
       _tf_answers_: ["Less than half","Between one-half and three-quarters"
                  "More"]
      }
    ]
}
```

The fifth question is about the workload distribution:

```json
{
   "_TF_QUESTIONS": [
        {
            CODE":"WL001Q1-01",
           NAME:"",

         DISPLAY_ORDER:"0.5", 
       _tf_answers_: ["Less than half","Between one-half and three-quarters"
                  "More"]
      }
    ]
}
```

The sixth question is about the workload distribution:

```json
{
   "_TF_QUESTIONS": [
        {
            CODE":"WL001Q1-01",
           NAME:"",
          TYPE_ID: 2,
         DISPLAY_ORDER:"0.5", 
       _tf_answers_: ["Less than half","Between one-half and three-quarters"
                  "More"]
      }
    ]
}
```

The seventh question is about the workload distribution:

```json

   "_TF_QUESTIONS": [
        {
            CODE":"WL001Q1-01",
           NAME:"",
          TYPE_ID: 2,
         DISPLAY_ORDER:"0.5",

                  "More"]
      }
    ]

```

Here is the JSON structure with all seven questions:
