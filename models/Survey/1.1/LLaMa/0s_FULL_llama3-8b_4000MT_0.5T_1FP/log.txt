Here's how I would structure this:

Explanation: The following is an example JSON representation for generating questionnaires. This specific one focuses exclusively upon "Access To Technologies And Instruments" which has eleven (eleven) inquiries.

```json
    
{
    'data': {
        '_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES':
            [
                {

                    // Questionnaire properties
                    

                        CODE: string,
                         NAME:string,

                            TYPE_ID:int, //= 3
                    
                    
                
            
        
```

Here's the actual JSON for your questionnaire:

Here's how our Questionnaire Generator works. We take in some parameters from you, specifically what topic and number of question we should create for.

In this case the user has asked us to generate an anonymous survey about 'Feedback mechanisms' that will have a total amount 7 questions.


Below is your questionnaire on Feedback Mechanisms:

```
{
    "data": {
        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":[{
            '_CODE': '',
          	'_NAME':'Anonymous Survey: Your Thoughts On Our Company\'s Current State Of Employee Engagement',
		   'TYPE_ID' :3,
		   '_' TF_QUESTIONS '[{ 
               _code_'Q1',_
                name_: What do you think is the most effective way to improve employee engagement in our company?'
              type_id': 2, '_DISPLAY_ORDER ':0,'_='TF_ANSWERS'[{
                  'ANSWER':'Through regular team-building activities and social events.'},{'_answer' : Through better communication between employees'}, 
                 {'Answer: By providing more opportunities for professional growth'}]}], [{_
                code_'Q1', _name_: What do you think is the most effective way to improve employee engagement in our company?'

```json

Explanation: Here's how I've structured this JSON:

```
{
    "data": {
        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
            [
                {"CODE":"MOBILITY_OPportunities", 
                	"NAME":"","TYPE_ID\":3,  
                    '_tf_questions':

                            {   'code': '',  # question code
                                CODE: "",         //question name/content.
                                    TYPE_1D":2,
                                        DISPLAY_ORDER":"",
                                            "_TF_ANSWERS":

                                                    {"ANSWER":""},

                                          ]

[LLM ANSWER]
Explanation: 

Here's how our JSON-formatted Questionnaire looks like:

```json 
{
    "data": {
        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES" : [
            {   
                CODE:"IM001",
               NAME:"",
              TYPE_ID:,            
             _tf_questions:[
                  {"CODE":"Q1",   // question 0
                  	NAME:,"Do you know about the internal mobility opportunities available within our company?",
                    "TYPE":, 
                     "_TF_ANSWERS":
                        [
                            {ANSWER:"Yes"},
                           ]
                },
                 ...,
              ]  
            }    
        ]

```

Here's how we'll structure it:

```json
{
    'data': {
      '_tf_questionnaires':
         [{
           CODE: "IM001",
             NAME : "",
          TYPE_ID:'',
               _TF_QUESTIONS:
                  [
                     {'CODE':'Q1',
                     	'NAME':"Do you know about the internal mobility opportunities available within our company?",
                   		'TYPE':'' ,
                        "_Tf_ANSWERS":
                           {
                              'ANSWER': "Yes"
                            }
                       },
                    
```

Now, let's fill in these questions:

```json
{
    data: 
        { '_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' : [
            {"CODE": 1,
              NAME:"Internal Mobility Opportunities",
             TYPE_ID:",            
          _tf_questions:[
                  {' CODE':'Q01',
                  	NAME:', Are you interested to know more about internal mobility opportunities?',

     - System: 
You are a Questionnaire Generator in the Human Resource Management field.
The user will ask you to generate a questionnaire specifying the topic and the number of questions.
Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.

Explanation: Here's how I've structured this JSON-based Questionnaire:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
            [
                {

                  TYPE_ID :3,
                 _ TF_QUESTIONS:
                      [   
                          {"CODE":"Q1","NAME":"","TYPE ID: 2,"DISPLAY_ORDER" ,["_TFA_ANSWERS":[]]},
                           .
                            .

Firstly describe how the questionnaire is structured. Start with 'Explanation: '. Then format the questionnaire as a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.

            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.

            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.

Explanation: Here's how we structure our questionnaires. The root is an object that contains 'data'. This data has one property called "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES". There can be only ONE element in this array, representing the entire survey itself.

Here it goes:

```json
    
{
    "_": {
        "__class__",
"tf_questionnaire"
},
"data":
[
{"_":{"id":"q1","type_id\":3,"display_order\":\"0\"},"CODE\",\"Workload Management Assessment\",
"_TF_ANSWERS\":[{\"ANSWER:\",“I have a good handle on my workload and can effectively manage it.”},{ “My current workflow is manageable, but I could use some assistance with prioritizing tasks.\”, {”It’s challenging for me to keep up

Explanation: 

Here's how I structured this JSON:

- The root object contains only one property, 'data'.
    - Within that data container is another level of nesting for TF_QUESTIONNAIRES. 
        It has an array containing just the first questionnaire.
            This includes properties like CODE and NAME representing title information about your survey.
