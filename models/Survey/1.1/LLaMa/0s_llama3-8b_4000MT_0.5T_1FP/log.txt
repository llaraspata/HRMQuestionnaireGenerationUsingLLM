      [
        { 
          'CODE': '', // code of the survey (e.g. WORKSTRESS)
            '_NAME':'Work Stress',
             TYPE_ID:3,  
           _questions':
              [                
                {'code':"Q1",  "name":"Do you often feel overwhelmed by your workload?",'type_id":2,'display_order',0,
                  "_answers":

Generate me a questionnaire on Course feedback

[LLM ANSWER]
Explanation:

Here's how I structured this JSON-based Questionnaire for "Course Feedback":

```
{
  'data': {
    '_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES':
      [
        { 
          CODE: '', NAME:'', TYPE_ID:', _Tf_QUESTIONS:
            [  
              {'CODE':'1.0','NAME':"How would you rate the overall quality of this course?","TYPE-ID":3,'DISPLAY_ORDER':''},
                {"ANSWERS":
                  [{ "Answer" : 'Excellent' }, 
                   {  '' },
                    ]},  

               // Add more questions here...

            ]
        }
      ]

}
```

Here's how I structured each question:

1. **Question Type**: The first part of the questionnaire is an overall rating for this course.

   * `CODE`: This code uniquely identifies a specific instance.
     - `'NAME'': A description that clearly conveys what you are asking about in your survey (e.g., "How would
       rate my experience with courses?").
    •  **TYPE_ID**: The question type is set to '3', which represents rating something.

   * `DISPLAY_ORDER`: This determines the order of questions displayed on a page.
     - `'ANSWERS'': An array that contains potential answers for this specific survey
       (e.g., "Excellent",,).

```
    {
      '_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES':
        [
          { 
            CODE: '', NAME:'Course Feedback', TYPE_ID:', _Tf_QUESTIONS:
              [  
                {'CODE':'1.0','NAME':"How would you rate the overall quality of this course?","TYPE-ID":3,'DISPLAY_ORDER':''},
                  {"ANSWERS":
                    [{ "Answer" : 'Excellent' }, 
                     {  '' },
                      ]},  

               // Add more questions here...

            ]
          }
        ]

}
```

Please let me know if you'd like to add any additional question types or modify the existing ones.

Explanation:

Here's how I've structured this JSON-based Questionnaire:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
      [
        { 
          CODE: 'ACCESS_TO_TECHNOLOGY',
            NAME:'Access To Tech & Tool Survey',  
           TYPE_ID :3,
         _QUESTIONS":[...]
       }
     ]
   }

```

Here's the Questionnaire:
```json

      [
        { 
          CODE: 'ACCESS_TO_TECHNOLOGY',

           TYPE_ID :3,
         _QUESTIONS":[

Generate me a questionnaire on Employee Potential

Explanation:

Here's how I would structure this JSON-formatted questionaire for you.

```
{
    "data": {
        "_TF_QUESTNAIRES":
            [
                {"CODE":"EPOT1", 
                	"NAME":"",
                    TYPE_ID:3,  
                  '_Tf_questions':
                      [   
                          {'code': 'QSTN01',  name:'What drives your motivation at work?', type_id :2 , display_order :'0' },
                            {
                              code':'ANSWER02',
                                ANSWER:
                                  [
                                    {"answer":"To achieve a sense of accomplishment"},
                                     { "Answer":   To gain recognition from my peers and manager" }
                                   ]
                             }  
                          ] 
                }]
}
```

Here is the questionnaire in JSON format:

```json
{
  "_TF_QUESTNAIRES":
    [ {
      CODE: EPOT1,
        NAME : Employee Potential Questionnaire ,
         TYPE_ID   :'3',
       _Tf_questions': [
          { 'code'     ':'QSTN01', 
            name:'What drives your motivation at work?' , type_id 2, display_order ''0'' },
           {
             code':'ANSWER02'
              ANSWER:
                [ {"answer":"To achieve a sense of accomplishment" } ,
                  {'Answer': " To gain recognition from my peers and manager"} ]
          }
        ] 
      }]
}
```

{
  "data": {
    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
      [
        { 
          CODE: 'FBM001',
           NAME:'FeedbackMechanisQuestionnare',  
            TYPE_ID':3,
         '_Tf_QUESTIONS':
              [   
                {'CODE':'Q1','NAME':"What do you think about the current feedback mechanisms used in our organization?",'TYPEID ': 2, 
                  'DISPLAY_ORDER:0,' _TF_ANSWERS':[{'ANSWER ':'Excellent'}, {''Good"}, {"Fair"}]},  
                
               ]
        }
      ]

Explanation:

Here's how I structured this JSON-based Questionnaire:
```json
{
    "data": {
        "_TF_QUESTNAIRES":
            [
                { 
                    CODE: 'JS1',
                  NAME :  **Job Satisfation Survey**,
                   TYPE_ID:'3', // Job Satisfaction questionnaire type (rating)
                 _Tf_questions':[
                        {'CODE':'QJ01','NAME' :'Overall, I am satisfied with my job.',TYPE_ ID ':'2'}, 
                         {_TF_ANSWERS':
                            [
                                {ANSWER: 'Strongly Agree'},
                                 1
                             ],
                          DISPLAY_ORDER :0},
                       // More questions...
                 ]
                }
            ]

}
```
Here is the generated JSON-based questionnaire for Job Satisfaction:

```json

                  NAME :'Job Satisfation Survey',  
                   TYPE_ID:'3' , // Rating type
                 _Tf_questions':[
                    {'CODE':'QJ01','NAME ':'Overall, I am satisfied with my job.',TYPE_ ID ':2'},  {/* rating */
                      '_TF_ANSWERS':
                       [
                          {ANSWER: 'Strongly Agree'},
                           {
                             ANSWER:'Somewhat Agreed',
                            DISPLAY_ORDER :1
                         },
                        ],
                    }, 
                   // More questions...
                 ]

Explanation:

Here's how our Questionnaire Generator structures questionnaires. The root object contains only one property, 'data', which in turn has another single-property: "TF_QUESTIONNAIRES". This array is comprised of just 1 element - the actual survey itself.

 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.
 - ID: 5, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to reorder items.
 - ID: 6, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to disribute weights across several items/options.
 - ID: 7, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to clone questions from a template.
 - ID: 8, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question when the answer to be given is a date or a date/time.
Be creative and vary the syntax of your questions to enhance user engagement.
Think about the questionnaire content step by step.

                     _tf_questions:[
                        { CODE:"rrq1",

                           DISPLAY_ORDER:,// The display order of the question.
                             "_Tf_answers":
                                [

 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.

            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.

Questionnaire Content:

Here's the content of this questionnaire, step by-step:
1. **Introduction**: Start with a brief introduction that explains what you're going to ask about.
2-4: The first three sections are focused on job satisfaction and cover different aspects like overall happiness at work ('How satisfied...'), role fulfillment (e.g., 'Do I have the resources needed?').

5,6. Next two questions assess how much autonomy they feel in their daily tasks ("I am able to make choices about my workload") as well whether or not there is a sense of camaraderie within your team ('How often do we collaborate on projects").

7-9: The following three sections deal with job security and growth prospects. You'll ask them if 'They have confidence in their future career path' (question 8), how satisfied they are about the likelihood that you will be able to advance professionally, as well whether or not there is a sense of belonging within your organization ('Do I feel like part this team?').

10: Finally we include an open-ended question asking them for any additional thoughts on job satisfaction.

Explanation:

Here's how our generated JSON will look like:
```json


{
  "data": {
    "_TF_QUESTNAIRES":
      [
        {

          // Questionnaire details 
            'CODE': '',  
          	'NAME':'Workplace culture',   
              '_TYPE_ID_:3, 

              

                _QUESTIONs':
                  [

                       ANSWERS':

                       


  }
```

Now let's create the questionnaire:

```json

Let's keep going with more questions:

                        {   
                          CODE: Q1WC04,

                           NAME:'Do you feel like your workplace encourages creativity and innovation?',

[LLM ANSWER]
Explanation:

Here's how I've structured this sample JSON for you:
```
{
  "data": {
    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
      [
        {

          // Questionnaire properties
        
         }
       ]
     }

}
```


JSON Structure: 
The root of the given structure is an object that contains a single property 'DATA'. The '_Tf_QUESTIONS' array within it will have only one element, representing this questionnaire. It has several other important elements:

1) CODE (string): This represents your unique code for identification.
2). NAME(string), TYPE_ID(int)=3: These represent the name of 
   and type respectively.

Here's how I've structured each question in '_Tf_QUESTIONS' array:
```
{
  "data": {
    "_TF_QUESTIONNAIRES":
      [
        {

          // Questionnaire properties
           CODE(string): The code for this questionnaire.
             NAME (string) : Name of your 
               TYPE_ID(int)=3: Type ID is equal to the number.

            '_Tf_QUESTIONS': An array that contains objects representing each question. Each object has several key-value pairs:

1).CODE,NAME(TYPE),DISPLAY_ORDER,int): Question's code and name along with its type.
2)._TF_ANSWERS(array of 
   {
     ANSWER(string)
    }
  )
```

Here is the generated questionnaire on Workplace Environment:
```json
