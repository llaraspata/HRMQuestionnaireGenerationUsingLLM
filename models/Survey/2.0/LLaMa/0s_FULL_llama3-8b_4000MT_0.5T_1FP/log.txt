Please note that I've converted the original questionnaire into the JSON format, but I've not included the "8" question as it's not clear what type of question it is (rating, feedback, etc.). If you can provide more information about this question, I can help you with that as well.

* Wrapped the questionnaire in an object with a single property 'data'
* Added a 'CODE' property to each question with a unique code
* Changed the question types to match the JSON format (e.g., '1' for a single-choice question, '4' for an open-ended question)
* Wrapped each answer in an object with a single property 'ANSWER'

1a/b: How often do the current Training and Development Programs align with my job responsibilities? 
Scale 4-point Likert Scale:
Not at all
Somewhat rarely, but occasionally useful when needed.
Mostly true for me; programs are relevant most of time!
Always – training is directly applicable to daily tasks!

1c/d: Which type(s) do you prefer:

Online courses/webinars | In-person workshops/seminars| On-the-job coaching/training

2. What's the top skill or knowledge area that would significantly impact your job performance?

(Open-ended text field)

Improved work processes
Enhanced collaboration/teamwork skills | Enhanced problem-solving abilities| Other: _______________________________

Please specify what you mean by "Other" in the next question.

(Open-ended text field)

5. What's one thing we could do to make training programs more engaging or effective for YOU?

(List of suggestions, e.g., gamification; real-world scenarios...)

6a/b/c/... (Choose up 3): How would you rate your overall satisfaction with our Training and Development Programs? 
Very satisfied
Satisfied | Neutral| Dissatisfified

7. Are there specific topics that are NOT covered in current training programs but should be?

(List of suggestions, e.g., diversity & inclusion; industry trends...)

8a/b: Would a more flexible scheduling option (e.g.: online modules) improve your participation and engagement with Training Programs?
Scale 4-point Likert Scale:
Strongly disagree

These questions are designed to provide insights into how our team members perceive current training programs, what skills they need for growth within their roles or across departments. This will help refine future initiatives that cater better.

[LLM ANSWER]
Here is an example workplace culture survey:

**WorkplaceCulture Survey**

We value open communication, collaboration & inclusivity in our work environment! Your input will help us better understand and foster the perfect blend of fun + productivity.

Please take your time to answer these quick Qs honestly!

1. On a scale from 0-10 (where "8" is neutral), how would you rate overall morale within teams at [Company Name]?

(What's driving that score? Is it recognition, team dynamics or something else?)

2a) Which of the following best describes your experience with company-wide celebrations & social events?
	* Love 'em! They bring us together
    * Meh... they're okay; could be better/greater variety 
        Not my thing – prefer quieter workspaces

(Any specific suggestions on what you'd like to see more/less of?)

2b) What's your go-to spot for team-building or relaxation within the office?
	* That one cozy corner with comfy chairs
    * The break room, where we grab a snack & chat 
        Outdoor spaces (if available); it feels fresh!

(Any ideas on what would make those spots even better?)

3. How often do you feel like your voice is heard and valued in meetings or discussions?
	* Always! I'm encouraged to share my thoughts
    * Most times; just need a little reminder 
        Rarely... sometimes things get too loud/too fast

(What's one thing we could change/donate more of?)

4. Would you recommend [Company Name] as an amazing place for colleagues & friends?
	* Absolutely! We're the best!
    * Yeah, it depends on who I'm asking...
        Not really; there are better options out here...

(Please share a brief story or anecdote that supports your answer!)

5a) What's one thing we could do more/better to show appreciation & gratitude?
	* Public recognition (shoutouts/awards)
    * Personalized notes/thank-you messages
        Surprise treats/snacks in the break room

(Any other ideas? Feel free! )

6. How would you rate your overall sense of belonging within [Company Name]?

(Would love to hear more about what makes this a great place for YOU!)

7a) What's one change we could make (or already have made?) that has positively impacted the work environment?
	* Flexible scheduling & remote options
    * Regular team-building activities/outings 
        More opportunities/mentorship programs

(Please share any additional thoughts or suggestions you might want to add)

Thanks for taking your time! Your input matters – we're all ears!
