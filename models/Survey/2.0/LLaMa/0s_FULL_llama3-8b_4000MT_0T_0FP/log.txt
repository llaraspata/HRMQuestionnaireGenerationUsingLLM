Here is a questionnaire on Employee Feedback with 4 questions:

**Employee Feedback Questionnaire**

We value your opinion and want to hear from you! Your feedback will help us understand what we're doing well and where we can improve. Please take a few minutes to answer the following questions:

1. **What's the most important thing that motivates you to come to work every day?**

Is it the sense of accomplishment, the opportunity to work with a great team, the chance to learn and grow, or something else? Please describe what drives you.

2. **What's one thing we could do to make your work experience better?**

Is it more training or resources, a more flexible schedule, or something else entirely? We're open to hearing your ideas and making changes to support your success.

3. **How do you currently receive feedback on your performance or ideas?**

Do you feel like you're getting the feedback you need to grow and develop, or is there something missing? Please share your thoughts on how we can improve our feedback process.

4. **What's one thing you wish you could tell your manager or HR about your job or work environment?**

Is it a concern, a suggestion, or a question? We're here to listen and want to make sure we're supporting you in the best way possible.

Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with us! Your feedback is invaluable.

Note that I've converted the questionnaire into a JSON format, with each question represented as a separate object within the `_TF_QUESTIONS` array. The `TYPE_ID` field specifies the type of question (in this case, a multiple-choice question, a multiple-select question, an open-ended question, etc.). The `_TF_ANSWERS` field contains an array of possible answers for each question.
