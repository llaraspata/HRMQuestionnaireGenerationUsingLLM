Note that I've used the `ANSWER` property to represent the possible answers for each question. For questions with multiple answers (e.g. `q1`), I've listed the possible answers as separate objects in the `_TF_ANSWERS` array. For questions with open-ended text fields (e.g. `q2` and `q6`), I've represented the answer as a single object with a single property `ANSWER` containing the text field.

• Set realistic goals and deadlines for yourself


Other: _______________________________________________________
