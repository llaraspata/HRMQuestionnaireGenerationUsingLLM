Note that I've used the type ID 3 for the questionnaire, which corresponds to the "Rating" type of question. I've also used the type ID 1 for most of the questions, which corresponds to the "Single answer" type of question. For question Q7, I've used the type ID 6, which corresponds to the "Distribute weights" type of question.
