Note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 3 for the questionnaire, which corresponds to the "Employee motivation" topic. I've also used the `TYPE_ID` of 1 for most of the questions, which corresponds to the "ID" type (single answer). The only exceptions are questions 2 and 7, which have a `TYPE_ID` of 4, which corresponds to the "DESCRIPTION" type (open-ended text).
