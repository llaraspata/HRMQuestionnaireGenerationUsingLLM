[LLM ANSWER]
Here's an initial draft for our investigation:

**Pressure At Work Questionnaire**

We're interested in understanding how you experience pressure while working here, so please take some time (about 10-15 minutes) to answer these questions. Your responses will help us identify areas where we can improve and support your well-being.

1a: On a scale of [0 - Not at all]to[5-Very much], rate how often you feel overwhelmed by work demands in the past month.
(Open-ended response)

2b (Select one): When feeling pressured, which statement best describes what happens to me:
	* I tend not take breaks and push through
    * My productivity increases temporarily before burnout sets it 
   Other: _______________________________________________________

3c. What are some common tasks or situations that make you feel pressure at work? (Check all applicable)
     • Meeting tight deadlines for projects/reports/tasks    
• Managing multiple priorities simultaneously   
	* Dealing with difficult colleagues, customers/clients
    * Handling unexpected workload changes 
   Other: _______________________________________________________

4d. How do your managers or supervisors typically respond when you express feeling overwhelmed?
(Select one):
      They listen actively and offer support  
     • Provide additional resources to help manage tasks   
	* Tell me I'm just being too sensitive/it's not that bad
    * Don't seem concerned, but still expect results

5e. Have there been times where pressure at work has negatively impacted your personal life? If yes:
(Open-ended response)

6f (Select one): What do you think would help reduce the feeling of constant pressurization?
     • Clearer expectations and priorities from management
    * More autonomy to manage tasks independently   
	* Regular check-ins with a supervisor or mentor 
   Other: _______________________________________________________

7g. Would your willingness/ability change if we implemented measures like flexible work arrangements, wellness programs,
or stress-reduction workshops? (Select one):
      Yes - I'd be more willing and able
     • No difference for me; it's not the solution   
	* Maybe – depends on specifics of program

8h. Any additional comments or suggestions about pressure at your workplace?
(Open-ended response)

Thank you so much! Your input is invaluable in helping us understand how we can better support our team members.

Please let know if this meets expectations, and I'll be happy to help with any further modifications before converting it into a specific format.

6. Are there any specific teams or departments that have a strong sense camaraderie (e.g., shared goals, social events)?

**Section 7: Feedback & Growth**

    + If yes/no:
        * What's the most valuable type of guidance you've received?

8. Are there any training or development opportunities that are not being utilized effectively (e.g., workshops, mentorship programs)?

**Section 9: Miscellaneous**
