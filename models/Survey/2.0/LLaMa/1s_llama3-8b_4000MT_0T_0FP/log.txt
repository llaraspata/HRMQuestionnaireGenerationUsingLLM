Note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 3 for the questionnaire, as per your request. I've also used the `TYPE_ID` of 1 for most of the questions, which corresponds to the "ID" type (single answer). The questions with no answer options (5, 6, and 9) have a `TYPE_ID` of 4, which corresponds to the "DESCRIPTION" type (open-ended text).

Note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 3 for the questionnaire, which corresponds to the "Onboarding" questionnaire.

The rest of the questions have different `TYPE_ID` values, which correspond to the other question types.

Note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 3 for the questionnaire, as per your request. I've also used the `TYPE_ID` of 1 for the "What is your current role in the company?" question, as it's a single-choice question. For the other questions, I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 6, which corresponds to the "rate something" question type.

Note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 3 for the questionnaire, which corresponds to the "Employee feedback" type. I've also used the `TYPE_ID` of 1 for most of the questions, which corresponds to the "Single answer" type. The questions that require multiple answers (Q2) or open-ended text (Q7 and Q9) have been assigned the `TYPE_ID` of 2 or 4, respectively.
