Note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` 1 for most questions, which corresponds to a multiple-choice question. For questions 10, 11, and 12, I've used the `TYPE_ID` 4, which corresponds to an open-ended question. For question 12, I've also used the `TYPE_ID` 8, which corresponds to a date or date/time question, but since this question is actually an open-ended question, it's not actually used for date or date/time input.

Note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 3 for the questionnaire itself, and the `TYPE_ID` of 1 for most of the questions, which is the default type for a single-select question. The questions that require multiple answers (e.g. "What motivates you...") have a `TYPE_ID` of 6, which is the default type for a multi-select question. The question that requires a date answer has a `TYPE_ID` of 8, which is the default type for a date question.

Please note that I've used the same `TYPE_ID` for all questions, which is `1` for multiple-choice questions. If you want to use different types of questions (e.g., rating scales, open-ended questions), you would need to use different `TYPE_ID` values.
