On a scale from 0-5, where:
* "2" means that training had no impact on my work
and 
*"4/3+/-= (or whatever) = I can apply what was learned to real-world situations and see tangible results"

How would you rate the overall effectiveness of this recent [insert name] course in improving your job performance?

(0 - Not at all effective, 1-2: Somewhat ineffective , 
   ...3/4 : Neutral,
    (5) Very Effective)

Please provide a brief explanation for why chose that rating.
