Please note that I had to make some minor adjustments to the original questionnaire to fit the JSON format. Specifically, I:

1. Changed the question types to match the admitted types (1-8).
2. Replaced the "Scale" and "Select all that apply" questions with single-answer options.
3. Removed the "What aspects contribute to this satisfaction/dissatisfaction?" question, as it didn't fit the JSON format.
4. Changed the "Have we provided adequate training, resources to develop these areas so far?" question to a single-answer option.
5. Removed the "Are there any specific goals or objectives you'd like set with your supervisor?" question, as it didn't fit the JSON format.

Let me know if you'd like me to make any further changes!
