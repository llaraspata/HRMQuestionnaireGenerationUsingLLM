Note that I've used the type ID 3 for the questionnaire, which corresponds to the "Manager feedback" topic. I've also used the type ID 1 for questions Q1, Q4, and Q5, which are single-answer questions. For questions Q2 and Q3, I've used the type ID 2, which allows for multiple answers. For question Q6, I've used the type ID 4, which is a feedback question.
