Note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 3 for the questionnaire, which corresponds to the "Rating" type. I've also used the `TYPE_ID` of 1 for most of the questions, which corresponds to the "Single answer" type. The only exception is question 2, which has a `TYPE_ID` of 2, corresponding to the "Multiple answers" type.
