Note that I've used type ID 1 for the first question, which is a single-choice question. For the second question, I've used type ID 2, which is a multiple-choice question. The third question is a rating question, so I've used type ID 3. The fourth question is an open-ended feedback question, so I've used type ID 4.

[LLM ANSWER]
Here's a sample questionnaire for investigating internal mobility opportunities within an organization:

**Internal Mobility Opportunities Questionnaire**

We're interested in understanding how employees perceive current job openings, career development prospects and the overall experience of moving internally at our company. Your input will help us identify areas to improve employee satisfaction, retention rates, and talent management.

Please answer these questions honestly based on your own experiences or observations:

**Section 1: Job Openings**

* How often do you hear about new job openings within departments other than yours? (Scale of frequency)
	+ Very frequently
    + Somewhat frequent 
    + Rarely/Never

Do the following statements apply to internal jobs:
    
* I'm aware that there are opportunities for growth and development in different roles.
* The company promotes available positions internally before considering external candidates.

**Section 2: Career Development**

What motivates you (or would motivate others) about exploring new job openings within our organization?

    * New challenges
	+ Opportunities to learn from colleagues or mentors 
   + Potential for increased responsibilities and impact on the business

Do any of these statements resonate with your experience:

* I've had opportunities in my current role that have helped me grow professionally.
* The company provides adequate training, resources, and support when transitioning into a new position.

**Section 3: Barriers to Internal Mobility**

What obstacles do you think prevent employees from exploring internal job openings? (Select all applicable)

    * Fear of change or uncertainty
	+ Limited visibility on available positions 
   + Concerns about being qualified for the role

Do any of these statements apply:

* I've seen colleagues struggle with adjusting after a transfer.
* The company could improve communication around new opportunities.

**Section 4: Feedback and Support**

How important is it to you that your manager or HR provides guidance on internal job openings?

    * Very Important
	+ Somewhat Important 
   Not at all

Do any of these statements resonate with the support received:

I've had a positive experience working closely with my supervisor during an internship.
The company's career development resources have been helpful in exploring new opportunities.

**Section 5: Additional Comments**

Is there anything else you'd like to share about internal mobility, job openings or your overall experiences within our organization?

Thank You for taking the time! Your input is invaluable!

[LLM ANSWER]
Here's a sample questionnaire for investigating internal mobility opportunities within an organization:

**Internal Mobility Opportunities Questionnaire**

We're interested in understanding how employees perceive current job openings, career development prospects and the overall experience of moving internally at our company. Your input will help us identify areas to improve employee satisfaction, retention rates, and talent management.

Please answer these questions honestly based on your own experiences or observations:

**Section 1: Job Openings**

* How often do you hear about new job openings within departments other than yours? (Scale of frequency)
	+ Very frequently
    + Somewhat frequent 
    + Rarely/Never

Do the following statements apply to internal jobs:
    
* I'm aware that there are opportunities for growth and development in different roles.
* The company promotes available positions internally before considering external candidates.

**Section 2: Career Development**

What motivates you (or would motivate others) about exploring new job openings within our organization?

    * New challenges
	+ Opportunities to learn from colleagues or mentors 
   + Potential for increased responsibilities and impact on the business

Do any of these statements resonate with your experience:

* I've had opportunities in my current role that have helped me grow professionally.
* The company provides adequate training, resources, and support when transitioning into a new position.

**Section 3: Barriers to Internal Mobility**

What obstacles do you think prevent employees from exploring internal job openings? (Select all applicable)

    * Fear of change or uncertainty
	+ Limited visibility on available positions 
   + Concerns about being qualified for the role

Do any of these statements apply:

* I've seen colleagues struggle with adjusting after a transfer.
* The company could improve communication around new opportunities.

**Section 4: Feedback and Support**

How important is it to you that your manager or HR provides guidance on internal job openings?

    * Very Important
	+ Somewhat Important 
   Not at all

Do any of these statements resonate with the support received:

I've had a positive experience working closely with my supervisor during an internship.
The company's career development resources have been helpful in exploring new opportunities.

**Section 5: Additional Comments**

Is there anything else you'd like to share about internal mobility, job openings or your overall experiences within our organization?

Thank You for taking the time! Your input is invaluable!
