Note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 3 for the questionnaire, which corresponds to the "Roadmap planning feedback" type.

The question about "What do you think are the most critical factors for the company's roadmap planning process to consider?" has a `TYPE_ID` of 6, which corresponds to the "Multi-select" type. The question about "What suggestions do you have for improving the company's roadmap planning process?" has a `TYPE_ID` of 4, which corresponds to the "Open-ended feedback" type.
