**Work Load Questionnaire**

As part of our ongoing efforts to improve work processes and employee well-being, we would like your input regarding workload management. Your responses will help us better understand the challenges you face in managing tasks effectively.

Please answer these questions honestly:

1.
How often do feel overwhelmed by an excessive number or complexity level
of assignments?

  - Almost always (4-5 times a week)
    Often enough to be noticeable, but not all of time. 
      Rarely; only when there is some unexpected task surge

2.

What are the most common factors that contribute your workload feeling too heavy? 

(Select up three options)

   Too many tasks assigned
  Tasks require more effort than expected (e.g., complexity or tight deadlines)
    Lack clear priorities for what needs to be done first 
      Unclear expectations from management about task scope and timelines

3.

How do you currently prioritize your work?

(Please select one option that best describes how often)

   Always follow a structured prioritization framework
  Most of the time, but sometimes adjust based on changing circumstances.  
    Rarely; usually just focus first come-first served or by urgency 

4.
What strategies have been most effective for you in managing your workload?

(Please select up to three options from below and provide any additional comments)

   Break tasks into smaller chunks
  Focus only one task at a time (single-tasking)
    Set realistic deadlines based on available resources 
      Delegate or outsource non-essential work when possible

5.
How satisfied are you with your current workload management process?

(Scale: Very Satisfied, Somewhat Satisfactioned,
Neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction)

6.

What would be the most helpful change to improve how well I manage my tasks? 

(Please select one option from below and provide any additional comments if desired)
   More training on prioritization techniques
  Clearer expectations for task scope & timelines 
    Accessible resources (e.g., templates, tools) or support team

7.
