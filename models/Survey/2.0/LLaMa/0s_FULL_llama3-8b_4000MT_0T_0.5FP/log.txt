**Career Path Clarity Questionnaire**

We want to understand how clear you are about your current and future careers within the company, as well as any challenges or opportunities that may be impacting this understanding. Your responses will help us identify areas where we can improve our support systems.

1a) On a scale of 0-5 (where 3 is "neutral"), rate how clearly defined do you feel about your current career path:

* Not at all clear
* Somewhat unclear, but I have an idea what's next for me.
* Neutral - my role and responsibilities are well-defined.

1b) What specific aspects of our company or industry excite/interest/distract from achieving clarity on this?

2. How often do you feel like your career goals align with the expectations set by management/supervisors:

Rarely
Sometimes, but I'm working to adjust my approach.
Most times - we're aligned and supportive.

3) What are some of the most significant factors that influence or hinder your understanding/progress towards a clear future in our company? (Select all applicable)

* Feedback from managers/co-workers on performance/strengths-weaknesses
* Opportunities for growth/training within my current role/team.
* Company-wide initiatives/priorities impacting job responsibilities.

4. Have you ever felt uncertain or unclear about your career path while working at this organization?

Yes, and it's been a persistent issue

Sometimes - usually during times of change/transition in the company
Rarely/no issues with clarity on my future within our org.
5) What specific actions would help improve communication around job expectations/goals/performance evaluations? (Open-ended response)

6. How important is having clear career guidance and support from HR or management to you?

Very Important - it's crucial for me.

Somewhat Important, but I can figure things out on my own
Not Very/At All Important

7) Have there been any instances where your understanding of a role/responsibilities changed significantly? If so:

Yes (please describe the situation and how this impacted clarity)

No/no significant changes in job expectations for me.

8. What are some potential benefits or outcomes that would make you feel more confident about pursuing career growth within our company?

(Select all applicable)
* Clearer roles/job descriptions
More opportunities to develop new skills/competencies.
Increased recognition/appreciation from management/co-workers

9) Are there any specific resources, training programs, mentorship initiatives (or other support mechanisms), that you think would enhance your understanding and progress towards a clear future within our company?

(Open-ended response)

10. Any additional comments or suggestions on how we can improve career path clarity for employees like yourself:

Thank-you! Your input is invaluable in helping us better understand the needs of all team members.

Here is a sample health and safety measures questionnaire for you:

**Health &amp; Safety Measure Questionnaire**

As part of our ongoing efforts to ensure the well-being and protection of all employees, we would like your input regarding current practices related to workplace hazards. Your responses will help us identify areas where improvements can be made.

Please answer these questions honestly based on what happens in a typical day at work:

_____________________________________________________________________

2. Have there been any near-miss incidents where an accident was narrowly avoided due to quick thinking and/or proper safety protocols?

Yes No

If yes: Please describe the incident in 1-3 sentences:

______________________________________________________________

3.
How often do you take regular breaks (e.g., stretching, taking a walk) during your workday? Do these activities help reduce fatigue or stress for yourself/your colleagues?



4. What is one thing we could improve upon to make our workplace safer and healthier?

_____________________________________________________________________

5.

Have there been any instances where an employee reported feeling pressured by management/supervisors regarding meeting deadlines, which may compromise safety protocols (e.g., rushing through tasks without proper precautions)?

Yes No

If yes: Please describe the situation in 1-3 sentences:

______________________________________________________________

6. How confident do you feel that your supervisor/manager would address any concerns or issues related to health and/or workplace hazards?

4= Somewhat Confident 
2 &amp; below: Not at All)

7.
What is one thing we could provide (e.g., training sessions) that you think would enhance your understanding or ability related to health and safety measures in the workplace?

[LLM ANSWER]
Here is a sample questionnaire for "Recognition and Rewards" topic:

**Recognizing Excellence: A Survey**

We value our employees' hard work, dedication, and contributions! To better understand what motivates you to excel in your role at [Company Name], we'd love it if you could take 2-3 minutes of your time to answer the following questions.

1. **What drives me**: When I receive recognition or a reward for my efforts:

a) It makes all the hard work worth it and gives me an extra boost.
b) It's nice, but not necessarily what motivates me most in this role.
c) Honestly? Recognition doesn't really impact how much effort I put into something.

2. **What matters**: In terms of recognition or rewards:

a) Public acknowledgment from my manager/team is the best way to feel valued and recognized for a job well done!
b) A tangible reward (e.g., gift card, bonus), no matter what form it takes.
c) It's not about me; I just want our team/department as whole be acknowledged.

3. **What would make an impact**: If we were considering implementing new recognition or rewards programs:

a) More frequent and spontaneous recognitions throughout the year!
b) A mix of both public acknowledgment AND tangible incentives for outstanding work.
c) Something entirely different (please specify in comments).

4. How often do you feel like your contributions are recognized by management?

* Always
* Most times, but there's room to improve 
* Sometimes/occasionally

5 **What would I love**: If we could offer more recognition or rewards for:

a) A specific achievement/project.
b) Consistently meeting/exceeding performance goals over time.

6. How important is it that our company recognizes and celebrates milestones (e.g., work anniversaries, years of service)?

* Very Important
* Somewhat Important 
Not very/ Not at all

7 **Any additional thoughts**: Is there anything else you'd like to share about recognition or rewards in [Company Name]?

Thank your for taking the time!

Note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` of 3 for the questionnaire, as per your request. I've also used the `TYPE_ID` of 1 for questions 1, 4, and the `TYPE_ID` of 2 for question 3, as these types of questions require selecting one or more answers from a list. Question 2 is a free-text question, so I've left the `TYPE_ID` as 4, which is for feedback questions.

4. **How would describe our company's values and mission statements align with your personal goals or motivations at work?
(Scale: 1 = Not Aligned;3=Somewhat Aligning ;5=Moderately to Highly)

What specific aspects of these core principles resonate most strongly for you?
