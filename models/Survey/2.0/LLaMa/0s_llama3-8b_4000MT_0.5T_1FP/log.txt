Please note that I've used the `TYPE_ID` 1 for most questions, which corresponds to a multiple-choice question. For questions that require open-ended text responses, I've used `TYPE_ID` 8. For questions that require the user to select a date or date/time, I've used `TYPE_ID` 8. For questions that require the user to rate their agreement or disagreement with a statement, I've used `TYPE_ID` 4.

[LLM ANSWER]
Here's an initial draft for our "Workloads" investigation:

**Section 1: Current Situation**

* How would you rate overall workload management in [Company Name]?
	+ Very effective, always meeting deadlines and expectations.
    + Somewhat manageable; some challenges arise occasionally. 
   Not very well-managed (often struggling to keep up).
     Extremely poor – feeling overwhelmed most of the time.

What specific aspects do we need improvement on? Please rank:
1) Prioritizing tasks
2)
3)

Do you have enough resources and support for your workload?
	+ Always, never a concern.
    Mostly; there's room left over. 
   Sometimes it gets tight – but I manage okay most of the time.

How often do stress levels rise due to work demands? (Scale: 1-5)
* Not at all
2) Rarely

**Section II - Task Management**

What percentage would you estimate is spent on:
	+ Urgent tasks that require immediate attention?
    Important but non-emergency projects?

Do these figures accurately reflect your current workload state?



How often do unexpected or last-minute requests impact daily work? (Scale: 1-5)
* Never
2) Rarely

**Section III - Communication**

What's the most significant communication challenge you face when managing a heavy load?
	+ Lack of clear expectations from management.
    Insufficient information sharing among team members.

Do these issues hinder your ability to manage workload effectively?



How often do meetings or discussions with colleagues/team leaders impact work schedule? (Scale: 1-5)
* Never
2) Rarely

**Section IV - Self-Care**

What self-care strategies help you cope during high-pressure periods?
	+ Prioritizing personal well-being, taking breaks.
    Seeking support from friends/family.

Do these coping mechanisms usually alleviate stress?



Would your ideal workload management system include more flexible scheduling or better resource allocation?
