Note that I've used the `ID` type for questions that require a single answer (e.g. "How long have you been with the company?"), and the `DESCRIPTION` type for questions that require multiple answers (e.g. "What motivated you to consider internal mobility?"). I've also used the `SCALE` type for the question "How important is internal mobility to you in your career development?" to allow respondents to select a value from a scale.

Please note that I've used the type ID 1 for most of the questions, which corresponds to a single-choice question. For the question "What types of recognition and rewards do you value most?", I've used type ID 2, which corresponds to a multiple-choice question. For the question "What do you think the company could do to improve recognition and rewards?", I've used type ID 4, which corresponds to an open-ended text field.

Note that I've used the `1` type for most of the questions, which corresponds to a single-answer question. The `worklife_balance_activities` question uses the `2` type, which corresponds to a multiple-answer question. The `worklife_balance_rating` question uses the `3` type, which corresponds to a rating question. The `feedback` question uses the `4` type, which corresponds to a feedback question.
