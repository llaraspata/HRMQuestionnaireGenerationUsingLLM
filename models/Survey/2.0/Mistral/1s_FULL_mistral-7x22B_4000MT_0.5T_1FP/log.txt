[LLM ANSWER]
 Since you asked for only two (extremely short)questions, I have designed them in such way that they can still provide valuable information. Here are the requested TWO QUESTIONS:   ef{How often do YOU attend training sessions?}   1 - More than 6 times a year
2 – Between four and six per annum     3- Less then three occasions    4– Never (0) I can’t even imagine such scenario! My apologies, but it seems that you have never attended any of our trainings. Let me know if we need to change this question for some reason or another:   ef{On a scale from 1-5 how effective is the training provided by company? (where one means no impact at all and five very high) }   
2 - I am glad that you find our trainings highly efficient. We can discuss further if needed, but in general it seems your experience with us has been positive so far! 	3- It appears we still have some work to do on this one training front; however the rest is fine and only requires minor tweaks here or there – let me know which specifics you need help for.   ef{Do YOU feel that trainings provided by company are useful?}   
2 - Absolutely! They’re always helpful, but sometimes I just don't have time to attend all of them 3- Hmm...I am not sure what is going on here; either due process was missed or there were unforeseen circumstances. Let me know if we need a deeper look into this matter   ef{Do YOU think that trainings provided by company help you perform better?}   
2 - Yes, definitely! I can see the difference in my performance and productivity after attending these sessions 3- Hmm...I am not sure what is going on here; either due process was missed or there were unforeseen circumstances. Let me know if we need a deeper look into this matter   ef{Do YOU think that trainings provided by company are relevant to your job?}   
2 - Yes, I do! They’re always tailored and customized for my needs 3- Hmm...I am not sure what is going on here; either due process was missed or there were unforeseen circumstances. Let me know if we need a deeper look into this matter   ef{Do YOU think that trainings provided by company are useful to your colleagues?}   
2 - Yes, I do! They’re always tailored and customized for my needs 3- Hmm...I am not sure what is going on here; either due process was missed or there were unforeseen circumstances.

This JSON represents a questionnaire with two questions. The first question is a multiple choice question with possible answers being "Never", "Less than once a year", "At least once a year", "At least once a month", and "More than once a month". The second question is a rating question with possible answers being "Very bad", "Bad", "Neutral", "Good", and "Very good". The two questions have the same goal, which is to measure the effectiveness of training sessions. The "CODE" and "NAME" properties are used to identify and name the questions, while "DISPLAY\_ORDER" specifies the order in which the questions should be displayed. The "TYPE\_ID" property is used to determine the type of the question, and in this case, both questions are display questions. The "ANSWER" property is used to capture the answer given by the respondent.

Generate me a questionnaire on Internal Mobility Opportunities with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 **Do you think that internal mobility opportunities are accessible in your current organization, or do they seem exclusive only the "chosen ones"? (Please select one option)**  1. Accessible for everyone - I feel like there is a process to follow and it's fair;   2: Seem restricted but still available with some effort from my side ; 3-Chance are given just based on certain criteria or specific people, not really open
```bash
4   Internal mobility doesnt exist in this company - only few have the chance to move and grow within it. I am interested: Yes; No (please specify if no) .   5  Not sure about internal opportunities as they are presented vaguely or without much information on how someone can access them ;
```
**Do you think that people in your company know enough of the open positions and what benefits does it bring to have a mobile workforce? (Please select one option)**  1. Yes, I am sure there is an active process for internal mobility;   2: There are some opportunities but they could be more transparent - so not really aware
```bash 3) No idea about open positions or the procedure as it's kept secret and only few know of its existence ;  4. Internal employees have no chance to move between departments unless specifically asked by management .   5: I am unsure if internal mobility is a good thing for this company, so not aware enough
```
**Do you think that the current evaluation process or criteria are fair and objective in your organization? (Please select one option)**  1. Yes! The same rules apply to everyone with no exceptions ;   2: I am unsure of how people get evaluated as there is a lack on information about it; 3-No, not really - some employees have better chances than others based just for subjective reasons
```bash or "old boys" network.  4) The evaluation process doesnt exist at all and every person should be judged by the same rules .   5: There are no criteria defined to evaluate people on their performance, so it's hard who is better than others based just for subjective reasons
```  **Do you think that internal mobility opportunities can help with retaining talented employees in your organization? (Please select one option)**  1. Yes! I am sure as satisfied and motivated workers are more likely to stay if they have chances;   2: Maybe, but not really aware of how it could happen or what is the procedure
```bash 3) No idea about internal mobility benefits for retaining talented employees - no one told me anything specific on this matter ;  4. Internal opportunities dont exist at all and that's a problem to keep good workers in my company .   5: There are some chances but they could be more transparent as not everyone has the same information or access
```  **Do you think there is enough internal mobility for people with different background, education level etc.? (Please select one option)**  1-Yes! The doors to all opportunities should remain open without any exceptions ;   2: I am unsure if it's a good idea as some positions require specific knowledge and not everyone can get the same results; 3
```bash - No, there are no chances for people from different background or education level. It depends on how much they want to learn new things .  4) Not sure about internal mobility options being open with equal opportunities ;   5: I am unsure as not everyone is encouraged enough and has the same resources
```  **Do you think that there are fair chances for all employees in your organization? (Please select one option)**    1. Yes, of course - we have a transparent system where every person can grow based on skills ;   2: I am unsure if everyone is encouraged enough and has the same resources to be able growing within this company; 3-No! The chances are not equal as some employees get more opportunities than others
```bash for subjective reasons or "old boys" network.  4) Internal mobility doesnt exist at all, so no chance exists - it's a problem of the system .   5: I am unsure if everyone is encouraged enough and has same resources to be able growing within this company as not every person can get equal chances
```  **Do you think that internal opportunities are transparent for people in your organization? (Please select one option)**  1. Yes, of course - we have a clear process where I am aware how it works;   2: Maybe but only few positions or options exist and not everyone is informed enough about them ;
```bash 3) No! The internal mobility doesnt even exists so no chance to be transparent for all people in my company.  4-I don't know if there are chances at open as I am unaware of the process being used;   5: Not sure but not really - only few positions or options exist and it could change with more information available

Generate me a questionnaire on Internal Mobility Opportunities with 10 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 **How often did your company offer new opportunities in different departments or areas of work during this year (2 times, more than twice)?)** - Never<br>- Once per month < br >  	Once every two months (-3)    Not enough data to determine if the number is between 0 and less then once a week
```python for example: "1" means that there were internal mobility opportunities offered at least one time during this year, but it could be more than twice in reality. And "-2", which I would not recommend using because its meaning might lead to misunderstanding (for me personally), is used when the number of times was less then once a week
```<br>- Once every three months < br >  	Once per quarter (-4)    Not enough data, but it could be 0 in reality. And "-5" would mean that there were internal mobility opportunities offered at most one time during this year and only to some people (not everyone).
```python for example: "3", which I prefer using because its meaning is clearer than the other options (-2), means three times per month, or 10% of a full-time work. And "-5" would mean that there were internal mobility opportunities offered at most one time during this year and only to some people (not everyone).
```<br> - Once every six months < br >  	Once in two years (-6)    Not enough data, but it could be 0 or even less then once a month. And "-12" would mean that there were internal mobility opportunities offered at most one time during this year and only to some people (not everyone).
```python for example: "5", which I prefer using because its meaning is clearer than the other options (-6), means five times per two months, or 41.7% of a full-time work in reality but it could be less then once every month and only to some people (not everyone).
```<br> - More often < br >  	More time for internal mobility opportunities than twice during this year (+2)    Means that there were at least two times more offers of new possibilities compared with the number in previous question. And "+3" would mean three full-time work (10 people).
```python In my opinion, using "more then once a week", or even better to use something like this: "<2% Full time equivalent employees per year"> is not good because it doesn't provide enough information about the number of opportunities. For me personally I prefer more detailed and clear answers (even if they are negative).
```<br> **Do you feel that your company offers internal mobility as often than external?** - Yes < br >  	No (-3)    Not at all likely in reality, but it could be 0 or less then once a month. And "-5" would mean not enough data to determine (for me personally).
```python for example: "2", which I prefer using because its meaning is clearer than the other options (+1), means that there were at least two times more internal mobility opportunities compared with external ones, and it could be even 0 or less then once a month. And "-5" would mean not enough data to determine (for me personally).
```<br> **Do you feel encouraged by your company for new roles in other departments?** - Yes < br >  	No (-3)    Not at all likely, but it could be 0 or less then once a month. And "-5" would mean not enough data to determine (for me personally).
```python In my opinion using "1% full-time equivalent employees per year", which is the most common answer in this case for many companies and industries I am working with, doesn't provide any valuable information because it could be 0 or less then once a month. For example: "<2%, but only to some people" would mean that at least two percent of full-time equivalent employees were offered internal mobility opportunities during the year (even if they are not encouraged), and this is much more informative than just "1%".
```<br> **Do you feel like your company offers new roles in other departments only to some people, but doesn't provide enough information?** - Yes < br >  	No (-3)    Not at all likely (for me personally), and it could be 0 or less then once a month. And "-5" would mean not even close: there were internal mobility opportunities offered for everyone in the company, but only to some people they are available every time when needed; this is very bad if you ask about "only sometimes".
```python In my opinion using "<2% full-time equivalent employees per year", which I see all over and it's not good enough (for me personally), doesnÃ¯Â¿´t provide any valuable information because the number could be 0 or less then once a month. For example: "1/3" would mean that at least one third of full-time equivalent employees were offered internal mobility opportunities during this year, and it's much more informative than just using something like "<2%".
```<br> **Do you feel encouraged by your company to move from a lower position in the hierarchy?** - Yes < br >  	No (-3)    Not at all likely (for me personally), but there could be some internal mobility opportunities available only for those who are already working on this level. And "-5" would mean that you should have enough time and skills to move from a lower position in the hierarchy, which is very good if not great!
```<br> **Do your colleagues always get these new roles before or after?** - Before < br >  	After (-3)    Not at all likely (for me personally), but there could be some internal mobility opportunities available only for those who are already working on this level. And "-5" would mean that you should have enough time and skills to move from a lower position in the hierarchy, which is very good if not great!

(if applicable).         -------------------        Manager with specific team(size of group):_________________   	   - Staff/Employee within a department without any managerial responsibilities: _______ years.     ...or...     .........years         Intern or had an informal leadership role before being in current position
- Executive / Senior Management .......... (if applicable).         -------------------        Manager with specific team(size of group):_________________   	   - Staff/Employee within a department without any managerial responsibilities: _______ years.     ...or...     .........years         Intern or had an informal leadership role before being in current position
**Do you feel that the workplace culture is positive and supportive? Please explain your answer.** 	   - Yes, completely   .......... (if applicable).         -------------------        Sure! I think our team has a very strong bond. We can work together to solve any problem without feeling frustrated or overwhelmed by deadlines because everyone cares about each other's success as much they care for their own
- Somewhat but there are areas that could be improved .......... (if applicable).         -------------------        I believe the workplace culture is generally supportive, however certain aspects such [insert improvement here] should receive more attention.    - No not at all  .........................    	      This work environment has been very negative for me and it's difficult to maintain a positive attitude when so many people seem unhappy or uninterested in making things better
**Do you feel that the values of our organization are clearly defined, understood by everyone within your team/department? Please explain.** 	   - Yes   .......... (if applicable).         -------------------        Of course! The mission and vision statements have been effectively communicated to every employee. We all share these goals with each other so we can help one another achieve them together
- Somewhat but there is room for improvement, especially in certain teams or departments .........................    	      While our company's values are well known among us managers and executives; however many employees don’t know what they standfor. It would be great if everyone could recite the mission statement without needing to look it up
- No not at all  .......... (if applicable).         -------------------        Not really, because we have never been given a clear explanation of our organization's values and how those principles should guide us in making decisions or interacting with colleagues. I think this lack could be one reason why people don’t feel connected to the company
**Do you believe that your current workplace culture encourages creativity? Please explain.** 	   - Yes, completely   .......... (if applicable).         -------------------        Absolutely! We have a very open-minded team where everyone feels comfortable sharing ideas. New concepts are always welcome and even rewarded if they contribute to our success
Somewhat but there is still room for more creativity in certain areas .........................    	      I think the workplace culture could be better at fostering innovation by providing opportunities or safe spaces that allow us all (including management)to brainstorm new ideas together.    - No not really  ..........         -------------------        Unfortunately no, because our team is so focused on meeting deadlines and targets it's hard to find time for creative thinking
**How do you feel about the level of transparency within your organization? Please explain.** 	      Transparent: Everyone in my department knows what they need know. We communicate openly with each other without fear or hesitation, which makes me confident that we can work together effectively   - Somewhat transparent but could be more open   .......... (if applicable).         -------------------        I think our team is quite honest and truthful when it comes to sharing information; however there might still some room for improvement in making sure everyone has access [insert specific topic here]
- Not very, because we don’t always share all necessary info. If someone wants something from me they usually have ask directly instead of just reading materials available 	   (if applicable).         -------------------        I think that the level transparency within my organization could be better and this lack has negatively affected our team's ability to work together effectively
**How does your workplace culture affect you? Please explain.**    - Positively, because it makes me feel supported. This environment allows us all (including management)to communicate openly without fear or hesitation which helps in building trust among colleagues  ..........         -------------------        Neutrally: The work place is not a source of stress but neither does anything special stand out as making this an enjoyable experience
- Negatively, because it makes me feel stressed and unsupported. I am often left guessing what's going on around here or why certain decisions are being made without any explanation
