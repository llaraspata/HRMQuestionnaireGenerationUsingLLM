Generate me a questionnaire on End of working relationship

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is one possible version for aquestionaire about end-of–working relationships:
```vbnet
1) How many people in this organization have experienced an "end" or termination with their employer? (Multiple Choice - Yes / No ) 2a. If yes, how long has it been since they left the company and what was reason for leaving ?  3b .If no , do you think that person would be willing to share if asked in a confidential manner about why he/she decided not continue with employer?
4) What is your opinion on people who have had multiple "ends" or terminations within this organization, versus those whose only experience was leaving voluntarily and by choice ? 5a. Do you think that the reason for end-of–working relationship affects future employment opportunities of person involved in it negatively?  6b .If yes , what are some reasons considered negative enough to affect someone's chances at another job, even if they were let go unjustly or without proper notice ?
7) In your opinion how long should an employee stay with a company before leaving voluntarily and by choice is seen as positive? 8a. Do you think that people who leave after short period of time are less committed than those staying longer term, even if they perform equally well during their tenure at the organization ?
9b .If yes , what do YOU consider minimum length for someone to be considered "loyal" and valuable employee? 10) How does end-of–working relationship affect team morale in general within an office or workplace setting, regardless of whether person was let go unjustly/by choice /etc. ?

O2 Do you think that all of theseemployees are able top perform their jobtasks with ease and without any restrictions due tonecessary technology/ tools ?  03 Is there a process for requesting new technologiesor upgrades, if so what is it , how long doesit take to get approved? 	O4 Do you think that the current accessibility oftechnology /tools in this companyis sufficient and meets all employees' needs or not (please specify)?  05 Is there a technology/tool budget for eachdepartment, if so what is it , how doesit compare to other departments? 	6) Are you satisfied with the current stateof accessibility oftechnology /tools in this companyor do we need improvement ?
```If they want another format: Sure! Here's a version that can be converted into an HTML table. This is often used for surveys and questionnaires, as it makes them easy to read but also quicker than typing out each individualquestion manually every time . Let me know if this works better or not !

Generate me a questionnaire on Feedback Mechanisms

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a potentialquestionaire about feedback mechanisms:
```vbnet
1) How do you typically receive performance reviews? (either through scheduled meetings or via email, etc.) Do they feel meaningful and constructive to YOU personally as an employee of the company ? 	   2 ) On scale from one-to ten how would rate your overall satisfaction with current feedback mechanisms in place at our organization.
3) How often do you get a chance for providing input on others work? Is it enough or not, according TO YOUR opinion and experience working here so far .  4 ). Do YOU think that people are generally open to receiving constructive criticism about their performance ? 	   5 ) Are there any specific things which could be improved in terms of how feedback is given at our company (for example: more frequent meetings or perhaps a different format)
6). In your opinion, what would make the most effective and efficient way for people within this organization to receive constructive criticism about their performance? 	   7 ) Do you feel that there are any barriers which prevent employees from giving feedback on others work (for example: fear of retaliation or not feeling comfortable)
8). How do YOU prefer receiving positive reinforcement ? Is it important for your motivation and productivity at workplace, if yes how so.  9 ). In general , what is the most effective way to give someone a compliment in order that they feel appreciated? 	   10 ) Do you think there should be more or less structure around giving feedback within our organization (for example: scheduled meetings with specific questions)

[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a potentialquestionaire about feedback mechanisms:
```vbnet
1) How do you typically receive performance reviews? (either through scheduled meetings or via email, etc.) Do they feel meaningful and constructive to YOU personally as an employee of the company ? 	   2 ) On scale from one-to ten how would rate your overall satisfaction with current feedback mechanisms in place at our organization.
3) How often do you get a chance for providing input on others work? Is it enough or not, according TO YOUR opinion and experience working here so far .  4 ). Do YOU think that people are generally open to receiving constructive criticism about their performance ? 	   5 ) Are there any specific things which could be improved in terms of how feedback is given at our company (for example: more frequent meetings or perhaps a different format)
6). In your opinion, what would make the most effective and efficient way for people within this organization to receive constructive criticism about their performance? 	   7 ) Do you feel that there are any barriers which prevent employees from giving feedback on others work (for example: fear of retaliation or not feeling comfortable)
8). How do YOU prefer receiving positive reinforcement ? Is it important for your motivation and productivity at workplace, if yes how so.  9 ). In general , what is the most effective way to give someone a compliment in order that they feel appreciated? 	   10 ) Do you think there should be more or less structure around giving feedback within our organization (for example: scheduled meetings with specific questions)

3) How often do you get a chance for providing input on others work? Is it enough or not, according TO YOUR opinion and experience working here so far .  4 ). Do YOU think that people are generally open to receiving constructive criticism about their performance ? 	   5 ) Are there any specific things which could be improved in terms of how feedback is given at our company (for example: more frequent meetings or perhaps a different format)

 Sure! Here is a potential satisfaction survey for you:
```vbnet
1) On average, how satisfied are YOU with life? (scale from very unsatisfied=0 and Very satisified =5 ) Please enter your answer in the format of 2 digit number. For example if it's five then write as "0" before this to make two digits together eX:  
    If you feel neutral about something, please select option '3'. This will help us understand how many people are indifferent and we can work on making them like the product more! 😊👍😐😔[2 digit number] % of participants selected this as their answer. Please enter your response:
```
Let's convert it into a specified format, for example "Markdown" or any other text formatting language you prefer to use in order not only make the survey look more attractive but also easier and funnier! 😊 Here is how our questionnaire would like if we decide on using Markown: (Please note that this will be just an aesthetic change)
```vbnet
- How satisfied are YOU with life? Please select one of these options. If you feel neutral about something, please choose option '3'. This way it's easier for us to understand how many people don’t like the product and we can work on making them more happy! 😊👍😐😔 [2 digit number] %

[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a potentialquestionaire about work-life balance:
```vbnet
1) How do you define "work" versus “personal life”? Is there even such thing as true separation between the two, or are they constantly blending together in your mind and body (e.g., thinking of something that needs to be done at home while on vacation)? 5-point scale:
0 - Never think about work when not working; completely separate identities for both personal life & professional duties/responsibilities /li>1 — Sometimes mix up the two, but it’s rare and doesn't cause any issues or stress. <br/>2 -- Mixing of these 2 entities happens more often than once in a while (but not all day every-day) with minimal impact on overall wellbeing/happiness /li>3 – Frequent blending between work & personal life, causing some level but manageable amount stress and tension. <br/>4 -- Constantly thinking about both professional duties AND home responsibilities; can’t seem to get a break from either one or another no matter how hard I try!
2) On average per week (excluding sleep), what percentage of time do you spend on work-related activities? 0 - Less than half /li>1 -- More likely around the same amount as nonwork, but not quite yet at overload. <br/>3 – Definitely more hours spent working compared to personal life; it’s tough balancing everything!
4) How many vacation days do you take per year? 0 - None or less than two /li>1 -- Three-Four Days Off Per Year, But Still Can't Seem To Fully Unwind And Relax. <br/>2 – Four Or Five Day Trips Are Just Right For Me; Gives Enough Time Away From Work While Not Feeling Guilty About Being Absent /li>3 -- Six-Seven Days Off Is Perfect Balance Between Personal Life & Professional Responsibilities
5) How often do you feel burned out? 0 - Never, I have a good work/life balance. <br/>1 – Rarely (maybe once every few months), but it still hurts when happens! /li>2 -- More than twice per year; need to recharge and refocus regularly in order not be overwhelmed by responsibilities at home or office
6) How do you feel about technology being always “on”? 0 - I love having access anytime, anywhere. <br/>1 – It’s nice but can get annoying sometimes when bombarded with messages/emails even during personal time /li>2 -- Hate it! Need my privacy and space away from work-related tasks in order to feel rejuvenated again
7) How do you prioritize your health? 0 - I am very diligent about taking care of myself, both physically AND mentally. <br/>1 – Somewhat important; try not let things slide too much even though sometimes hard because so many demands on my time /li>2 -- Not really a priority right now due to other commitments and responsibilities at work/home
8) How do you prioritize your family? 0 - I am very diligent about taking care of them, both physically AND mentally. <br/>1 – Somewhat important; try not let things slide too much even though sometimes hard because so many demands on my time /li>2 -- Not really a priority right now due to other commitments and responsibilities at work/home
9) How do you prioritize your friends? 0 - I am very diligent about taking care of them, both physically AND mentally. <br/>1 – Somewhat important; try not let things slide too much even though sometimes hard because so many demands on my time /li>2 -- Not really a priority right now due to other commitments and responsibilities at work/home

Generate me a questionnaire on WorkLife Balance

[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a potentialquestionaire about work-life balance:
```vbnet
1) How do you define "work" versus “personal life”? Is there even such thing as true separation between the two, or are they constantly blending together in your mind and body (e.g., thinking of something that needs to be done at home while on vacation)? 5-point scale:
0 - Never think about work when not working; completely separate identities for both personal life & professional duties/responsibilities /li>1 — Sometimes mix up the two, but it’s rare and doesn't cause any issues or stress. <br/>2 -- Mixing of these 2 entities happens more often than once in a while (but not all day every-day) with minimal impact on overall wellbeing/happiness /li>3 – Frequent blending between work & personal life, causing some level but manageable amount stress and tension. <br/>4 -- Constantly thinking about both professional duties AND home responsibilities; can’t seem to get a break from either one or another no matter how hard I try!
2) On average per week (excluding sleep), what percentage of time do you spend on work-related activities? 0 - Less than half /li>1 -- More likely around the same amount as nonwork, but not quite yet at overload. <br/>3 – Definitely more hours spent working compared to personal life; it’s tough balancing everything!
4) How many vacation days do you take per year? 0 - None or less than two /li>1 -- Three-Four Days Off Per Year, But Still Can't Seem To Fully Unwind And Relax. <br/>2 – Four Or Five Day Trips Are Just Right For Me; Gives Enough Time Away From Work While Not Feeling Guilty About Being Absent /li>3 -- Six-Seven Days Off Is Perfect Balance Between Personal Life & Professional Responsibilities
5) How often do you feel burned out? 0 - Never, I have a good work/life balance. <br/>1 – Rarely (maybe once every few months), but it still hurts when happens! /li>2 -- More than twice per year; need to recharge and refocus regularly in order not be overwhelmed by responsibilities at home or office
6) How do you feel about technology being always “on”? 0 - I love having access anytime, anywhere. <br/>1 – It’s nice but can get annoying sometimes when bombarded with messages/emails even during personal time /li>2 -- Hate it! Need my privacy and space away from work-related tasks in order to feel rejuvenated again
7) How do you prioritize your health? 0 - I am very diligent about taking care of myself, both physically AND mentally. <br/>1 – Somewhat important; try not let things slide too much even though sometimes hard because so many demands on my time /li>2 -- Not really a priority right now due to other commitments and responsibilities at work/home
8) How do you prioritize your family? 0 - I am very diligent about taking care of them, both physically AND mentally. <br/>1 – Somewhat important; try not let things slide too much even though sometimes hard because so many demands on my time /li>2 -- Not really a priority right now due to other commitments and responsibilities at work/home
9) How do you prioritize your friends? 0 - I am very diligent about taking care of them, both physically AND mentally. <br/>1 – Somewhat important; try not let things slide too much even though sometimes hard because so many demands on my time /li>2 -- Not really a priority right now due to other commitments and responsibilities at work/home
