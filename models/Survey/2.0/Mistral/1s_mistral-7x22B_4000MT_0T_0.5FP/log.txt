Do you believe that the company offers a sufficient number of benefits to employees (e.g., health, dental and vision insurance)? If not please elaborate. -> Yes it does offer those things but there are other factors like cost or eligibility requirements which might prevent people from accessing them fully; this could be improved by reducing barriers such as making these services more affordable

Generate me a questionnaire on Employee Potential

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 **Do you believe that your potential is being fully utilized within this organization, considering both personal and professional growth opportunities available to all team members in similar roles as yours?** 	- Yes, definitely. I am given the opportunity for advancement whenever possible based solely upon my skills and performance.  
 - To some extent yes but there are still areas where more can be done by management or myself with additional training/experience gained over time to reach full potential within this organization.   
 	- No, not really because I feel that the opportunities for growth have been limited due either lack of resources available and my skills could benefit from further development in a different role if given chance through internal promotion process at some point soon  
 - Not even close as it seems like there is no path forward within this organization to reach full potential based on current job responsibilities, team structure or management approach. 	
**Do you feel that the company provides enough resources and support for personal growth? (training materials/courses etc.) **   
- Yes, completely  
 - To some extent but could be better with more investment in this area by leadership teams to help employees reach their full potential within organization    
 - No not really as it seems like there is no clear path or resources available for me and my colleagues that would allow us all the chance of reaching our true personal growth goals  
- Not at all, I feel left behind with little support from management in terms of providing tools/resources needed to reach full potential within this organization. 	
**Do you believe your current role is a good fit for realizing and maximizing employee's skills? (considering both hard & soft ones)**   
- Yes definitely, my job responsibilities align perfectly with what I am best at  
 - To some extent but there are areas where more can be done by management or myself to better match the role requirements.    	 
- Not really as it seems like this position does not allow me full use of all skills and abilities that would make a difference in performance if given chance through internal promotion process at point soon  
 - No, I feel out place with current job responsibilities which do align well to my strengths or provide opportunity for growth within the organization. 	
**Do you think your potential is recognized by company leadership? (considering both hard & soft skills)**   
- Yes definitely and acted upon in terms of opportunities provided  
 - To some extent but could be better with more investment from management side to help employees reach their full growth goals within organization.    	 
- Not really as it seems like there is no clear path or resources available for me that would allow recognition by leadership teams based on current job responsibilities and team structure in place  
 - No, I feel unnoticed with little support from management to help employees reach their full growth goals within this organization.

(OSHA = Occupational Safety & Health Administration)
**How often do your company implement new health, hygiene AND SAFETY measures? Please select one option:** 
- Constantly evaluating and implementing changes as needed. We have a dedicated safety manager/team who is responsible for this task!

And this could help us prevent incidents from happening again in future too
- No, not at ALL as current protocols do NOT meet industry standards or even OSHA compliance officer on the safety committee! (including annual refresher training required) OR NO I don’t feel safe because we are constantly exposed to potential hazards without proper protection gear and equipment.

- No, not at ALL as current resources do NOT meet industry standards or even OSHA compliance officer on the safety committee. (including annual refresher training required) OR NO I don’t think my company provides adequate health & hygiene AND SAFETY equipment/resources for employees including protective clothing and other essentials which can help prevent incidents from happening again in future too

And this could help us prevent incidents from happening again in future too
- No, not at ALL as current work schedule does NOT meet industry standards or even OSHA compliance officer on the safety committee! (including annual refresher training required) OR NO I don’t feel safe because we are constantly exposed to potential hazards without proper protection gear and equipment.

- Never: _______% of the time or less than once per month.
- Rarely: ___ % of the time between one and three times a year but not as an ongoing concern.
- Occasionally :___ %of thetime, about twice monthly to six months; this is important enough that it should be on your mind more often.
- Frequently:_%_ _______times per month or weekly with some sporadic occurrences but not a constant thought process in place yet! You can do better than just thinking of health and safety measures once every two weeks, right? 😉 .50 % chance that you will think about it more often.
- Very Frequently: _______%_of the time or always on your mind as an ongoing concern; this is a great sign! You are committed to keeping everyone safe from harm's way and ensuring all safety protocols, procedures & guidelines meet industry standards too!! 90 % chance that you will think about it more often.
**Do health and Safety measures affect productivity in any manner? If yes then how (1 being not at all;5being very much)? **
- Not At All: _______% of the time, this is a great sign! Health & safety don't have to be an obstacle for your team.

- Slightly: _______% of the time, this is a common occurrence when people first start implementing new policies. It might take some getting used to but eventually becomes second nature! But don't worry; it won’t affect productivity significantly if you keep pushing forward with positivity & enthusiasm 😊 .
- Somewhat: _______% of the time, this could be due either lack or poor quality equipment/resources provided by management teams. It may also mean that your team needs more training on how to use these items properly so they don't cause harm unintentionally! However; if you address both issues simultaneously then productivity will increase gradually overtime 🤓 .
- Much: _______% of the time, this could be due either lack or poor quality equipment/resources provided by management teams. It may also mean that your team needs more training on how to use these items properly so they don't cause harm unintentionally! However; if you address both issues simultaneously then productivity will increase gradually overtime 🤓 .
- Very Much: _______% of the time, this is a serious issue and should be addressed immediately. It might mean that your team doesn’t feel safe at work or they aren't trained well enough to handle certain tasks without causing harm unintentionally! This could also indicate poor quality equipment/resources provided by management teams which needs urgent attention 🤓 .
**Do you think there are sufficient health and safety measures in place? (1 being not all;5being very much)? **

[LLM ANSWER]
 **What is your role in this organization currently, Executive / Senior Management; Manager ; Staff Member ?)**
  - Of course I am an executive! (or similar)
    * Great. Let's talk about internal mobility opportunities then... :)
  	* No need to be so aggressive :( Please ask me again and let’s continue with the questionnaire in a friendly way, thank you ;).
    
  - Manager; Staff Member or Other (please specify) ?)**
    * Sure! I am currently working as manager. How can this help us discuss internal mobility opportunities? :)
     	* Managers are often involved when it comes to filling open positions in the company, including those that could be filled by existing employees through promotions and transfers within departments or teams they manage; please tell me if you have been part of such a process. (Yes/No) ?)**
     - Yes I am! It's great because internal mobility can help organizations retain talent longer while providing opportunities for growth, learning new skills & experiences which ultimately leads to higher job satisfaction and motivation among employees like us too :) Let’s continue discussing this topic further if you want. (Yes/No) ?)**
    - No I am not involved in such a process at the moment but would be happy to contribute more! :( **In your opinion, how important is internal mobility for an organization?** 	* In my experience and based on what research says about it as well – yes, very much so. Internal opportunities can bring many benefits including retaining talent longer within company & providing growth paths which results in higher job satisfaction among employees like us too :) Can you tell me more reasons why internal mobility is important for an organization?**
    - Not really no :( It's just not something that we prioritize at this time. But maybe there are some specific cases when it could be useful, can I share them with You please ? **Do YOU think about your future career within the company and what steps should management take to make you consider internal mobility opportunities?** 	* Yes! Of course as a manager or executive in an organization one must always have eye on potential successors & plan for their growth too. Can we talk more specifically then, which actions could help me think about my future career within the company through promotions and transfers between departments/teams I manage?**
    - Not really no :( It's just not something that is considered at this time in our organization **How often do you discuss internal mobility opportunities with your team members or employees reporting to You directly (if applicable)? Can we make it more frequent, say once per quarter for example and why/why-not?** 	* Yes! I believe discussing about future career paths within company can be beneficial both personally & professionally. Let's talk then specifically what steps should management take so that internal mobility opportunities become a regular topic of conversation with team members or employees reporting to You directly, including making it more frequent like once per quarter?**
    - Not really no :( It’s just not something we prioritize at this time **Do you think there are any barriers for people within the company when considering internal mobility opportunities and if yes then what could they be (please specify)? If so, how can management address them to make process smoother?** 	* Yes! There might indeed exist some specific challenges which prevent employees from taking advantage of all great benefits that come with being part of an organization offering many development paths. Let's discuss then what could those barriers be and if we know about any, how can management address them to make process smoother?**
    - Not really no :( It’s just not something people talk or think much **Do you feel that internal mobility opportunities are communicated widely enough within the company (if applicable)? If so then what steps should be taken for better communication about those open positions and available development paths to all employees including new hires?** 	* Yes! I believe it's important not only offering but also effectively sharing information on various growth options. Can we talk more specifically, which actions could help us communicate internal mobility opportunities wider within the company so that every employee knows about them too & can take advantage of those great benefits coming with being part our organization?**
    - Not really no :( It’s just not something people think much **Do you feel there is enough support for employees considering to move internally and if yes then what could they be (please specify)? If so, how does management provide that internal mobility opportunities are supported with resources including training/education?** 	* Yes! I believe it's important not only offering but also providing necessary tools & knowledge required by people moving within company. Can we talk more specifically then about what could those supports be and if there any ways to make sure every employee has access them too, so that internal mobility opportunities are supported with resources including training/education?**
    - Not really no :( It’s just not something **Do you think it's easy for employees within the company considering moving internally (if applicable)? If yes then what could make this process even easier and if No, how can management help to simplify that transition as much possible by removing any obstacles?** 	* Yes! I believe making internal mobility opportunities accessible & simple is crucial. Can we talk more specifically about which actions would be helpful for employees moving within company so they feel supported during this process too with minimum effort from our side, please tell me if there are some ways to make it even easier and remove any obstacles?**
    - Not really no :( It’s just not something **Do you think internal mobility opportunities should become a part of the organizational culture (if applicable)? If yes then what could be done for that & how can management help in making this happen, please specify ?**. 	* Yes! I believe it's important to make sure all employees know about growth paths within company and feel encouraged taking advantage. Can we talk more specifically on which actions would allow us as managers or executives turn internal mobility into part of our organizational culture so that every employee knows how much they are valued & has chance for development?**

If yes then what would it look like, please specify ?**. 	* Yes! I believe having clear & measurable goals is crucial for any initiative.

[LLM ANSWER]
 **Who is your current leader at work, if applicable: Executive / Senior Management Manager Team Leader Other (please specify): __________**

**How long have you been working with this specific person in their leadership role? Less than 1 year Between 1 and 3 years More than three years Longer period of time Not sure about the duration:**

**Do your personal values align well or clash strongly with those displayed by your leader: Align very closely, no issues at all. Somewhat aligned but could be better in some areas Clashes significantly; I often feel frustrated and unheard Strongly disagree that my values match up to theirs.**

[Assuming you have a direct supervisor or manager] **How would you rate your current leader's effectiveness as an organizational head?** 5 out of 5: They are the best possible person for this role. I am very satisfied with them in charge, and they inspire me to be better at my job too!
4-3 range (neutral): Neither good nor bad; just average performance - not much impact on productivity or motivation either way Wouldn't give more than 2 stars because of some concerns about their decision making. I have reservations that this person is the right fit for a leader role in an organization!
1-3 range (not so great): This individual needs improvement, and they are not performing well as head or manager at all - would be happier if someone else took over 5 out of five: They're doing excellent work but could improve on certain aspects. I believe that with some effort to change a few things; this person can become even better!

**How often do you feel encouraged and empowered by your leader? Always, without fail Rarely or never Encouraged most times - just need little push Sometimes.** 5 out of five: They are always there for me when I have questions about my work. And they make sure that everything is done correctly!
4 range (neutral): Not much impact on productivity but not a negative influence either Wouldn't give more than three stars because leader doesn’t provide enough guidance or support to feel empowered in the role 2-3 star rating: I don't often get encouraged by my supervisor. They are rarely available for questions and advice, which makes me doubt their leadership skills!
1 out of five (not at all): My current manager never encourages nor empowers - they just give tasks without any explanation or support.** 5-3 range: I feel supported most times but could use more guidance. Would be better if my leader provided clearer instructions and expectations for me to follow!
2 out of five (not so great): My supervisor rarely provides the necessary resources, which makes it hard not only on productivity level - also feels like they don't care about their team members at all.** 5-3 range: I feel supported most times but could use more guidance. Would be better if my leader provided clearer instructions and expectations for me to follow!
2 out of five (not so great): My supervisor rarely provides the necessary resources, which makes it hard not only on productivity level - also feels like they don't care about their team members at all.** 5-3 range: I feel supported most times but could use more guidance.

[LLM ANSWER]
 **Please rate your overall satisfaction with our current roadmaps.**
  - Extremely satisfied
  - Somewhat dissatisfied, but willing to work through issues and provide constructive criticism.
  - Neutral or undecided about the value of these plans for you personally at this time.
  - Mostly unsatisfied with our current roadmaps due to specific concerns that need addressing before they can be fully implemented in your team/department, etc., and would like more information on how we plan to address them? (Please specify)
  	+ Extremely dissatisfied: There are significant problems or issues preventing you from implementing the plans. You believe these should have been addressed earlier but were not for some reason that needs further investigation before proceeding with implementation of any kind, etc., and would like more information on how we plan to address them?
  - Very unsatisfied due to a lack of understanding about why certain decisions or actions are being taken in the first place. You feel left out from important discussions regarding your team/department's future plans even though you should be involved because it directly impacts their work, etc., and would like more information on how we plan to address them?
  	+ Unsatisfied: There is a noticeable lack of communication between stakeholders about what needs doing next. This makes things feel chaotic or unorganized which can lead people feeling overwhelmed by too many tasks at once without enough time for reflection and adjustment, etc., but you are willing to work through issues if given the chance?
  	+ Somewhat unsatisfied: There is a noticeable lack of communication between stakeholders about what needs doing next. This makes things feel chaotic or unorganized which can lead people feeling overwhelmed by too many tasks at once without enough time for reflection and adjustment, but you are willing to work through issues if given the chance?
  	+ Neutral: You don't have a strong opinion about our current roadmaps. They seem fine from your perspective as an external observer with no direct involvement in their creation or implementation process at this point yet still interested enough that would like more information on how we plan to address them if there are any concerns?
  	+ Somewhat satisfied: You feel positive towards the plans but think they could be better. There might have been some miscommunication along the way, and you'd appreciate it if certain aspects were improved or clarified before fully committing yourself personally because that would help everyone else involved as well including those who created these documents in first place?
  	+ Extremely satisfied: The plans align perfectly with your expectations. Everything seems to be going smoothly according to plan, and no further action is required from you at this time other than sharing positive feedback about how great things are working out so far! (Please specify) 

**How well do our roadmaps reflect the needs of all stakeholders? Please provide specific examples if possible.**
  	+ Yes: Our current plans consider everyone's input and address their concerns. You feel that each person has been given equal consideration, which makes you confident in implementing these documents without hesitation or reservation because they seem perfect from your point view as an external observer with no direct involvement yet still interested enough to provide positive feedback about how great things are working out so far! (Please specify)
  	+ Somewhat: The plans mostly reflect the needs of all stakeholders, but there might have been some miscommunication along the way. You'd appreciate it if certain aspects were improved or clarified before fully committing yourself personally because that would help everyone else involved as well including those who created these documents in first place?
  	+ No: The plans do not reflect all stakeholders equally, and you feel left out from important discussions regarding your team/department's future. You believe certain people were given more consideration than others which makes it difficult for everyone to implement them without hesitation or reservation because they don't seem perfect according to plan? (Please specify)
  	+ Not at all: The plans do not reflect the needs of stakeholders, and you feel left out from important discussions regarding your team/department. You believe certain people were given more consideration than others which makes it difficult for everyone involved in their implementation without hesitation or reservation because they don't seem perfect according to plan? (Please specify)
  	+ Neutral: Not sure how well the plans reflect all stakeholders, and you would like some additional information about what went into creating them before making a decision. You are willing but not completely convinced yet that these documents will work for everyone involved in their implementation process at this point? (Please specify)
  	+ Somewhat satisfied: The needs of most people seem to be reflected well, and you feel positive towards the plans overall despite some minor issues with how certain aspects were handled. You think things could have been better if only a few more adjustments had been made before sharing these documents widely? (Please specify)
  	+ Extremely satisfied: The needs of all stakeholders seem to be reflected perfectly, and you feel that the plans are inclusive enough for everyone involved in their implementation process at this point. You believe things went smoothly according to plan without any further action required from your side other than sharing positive feedback about how great these documents turned out? (Please specify)
  	+ Very satisfied: The needs of all stakeholders seem mostly reflected well, and you feel that the plans are inclusive enough for everyone involved in their implementation process at this point. You believe things went smoothly according to plan without any further action required from your side other than sharing positive feedback about how great these documents turned out? (Please specify)
  	+ Unsatisfied: The needs of all stakeholders do not seem reflected well, and you feel that the plans are exclusive for some people involved in their implementation process at this point. You believe certain adjustments should have been made before sharing them widely because they don't appear perfect according to plan? (Please specify)

[LLM ANSWER]
 **How would rate the overall teambuilding activities organized by your company in terms of effectiveness and impactfulness (1-5 scale)? Please explain why.** ------------------- The rating system is as follows: - "1" indicates that you did not find any value or positive outcome from these initiatives.
	* "-2” to “3“ means the teambuilding activities were average, with some success but also room for improvement.- A score of '5' signifies a very strong agreement and belief in their effectiveness; it is important to provide reasons behind your rating choice.** ------------------- Please select one number from this scale:
	* Strongly disagree (1) - Disagree (2)- Neutral/Undecided- Agree (3) –Strongly agree(5)** How often does the company organize teambuilding activities?**  ----------- The options are as follows, with a brief explanation of each:
	* "More than once per quarter" - This indicates that your team is engaged in such exercises frequently. It could be beneficial to evaluate how well these events align and contribute towards achieving organizational goals.- “Once every 3 months”- A more moderate frequency for teambuilding activities, which may still provide positive outcomes but not as often desired by the organization or participants themselves
	* "Less than once per year" - This choice shows that your company does not prioritize such initiatives and could be missing out on potential benefits. Please select one option from above.** ------------------- The options are: More Than Once Per Quarter, Every Three Months Or Less Then One Time In A Year
	* **Do you think the teambuilding activities in our organization help to:**  ------------ This question is divided into two parts for better understanding. Please select one option from each part below and provide a rationale: ------------------- The options are as follows, with brief explanations of what they mean:- "Increase trust among team members"- “Improve communication between employees”
	* - Enhance collaboration within the organization.- Decreases conflicts in your workplace. Please select one option from above.**  ------------ Here you can choose only 4 options: Increased Trust, Improved Communication and Collaboration or Reduced Conflicts In The Workplace** How often do YOU participate personally? (1-5 scale) And why:**
	* Strongly disagree - You never take part in any teambuilding activities. It could be a sign of not being involved enough, which may affect your team's performance and overall success.- Disagree –You rarely attend these events due to various reasons like schedule conflicts or other commitments; it is essential for you as an influential member to participate more often
	* - Neutral/Undecided- Agree (3)–It does not matter whether I am present at such activities because they are effective regardless of my attendance. It would be better if there was a way to measure their impact on your team and organization.- Strongly agree(5)- You always participate in all teambuilding events since you believe that these initiatives contribute significantly towards building stronger teams, improving communication within the group
	* Please select one option from above.**  ------------ The options are: Never (1), Rarely Attend But Should Participate More Often Or Not Sure About It And Always. **Do YOU think teambuilding activities should be mandatory?** ------------------- This question is divided into two parts for better understanding, please choose only ONE of the following and provide a rationale behind your choice:
	* Strongly disagree - No one can force me to attend such events; it goes against my beliefs about voluntary participation. Mandatory activities may not bring desired results or even harm team cohesion.- Disagree –It is better if people could choose whether they want to participate in these initiatives, but making them mandatory might make some feel uncomfortable and unproductive
	* - Neutral/Undecided- Agree (3)–I am not sure about this topic. Mandatory or voluntary participation has its pros and cons; it depends on the situation.- Strongly agree(5)- Yes, teambuilding activities should be mandatory since they help build stronger teams with better communication skills
	* Please select one option from above.**  ------------ The options are: No One Can Force Me To Attend Such Events (1), Better If People Could Choose Whether They Want to Participate In These Initiatives But Making them Mandatory Might Make Some Feel Uncomfortable And unproductive, Not Sure About It and Yes.

[LLM ANSWER]
 **What is the current level of balance between your professional and personal life, in terms of time spent working or engaged with company activities vs. leisure hours?**
- Completely balanced: I have enough free time to enjoy myself without feeling guilty about not doing work tasks; this happens often (more than 50%).
- Somewhat unbalanced but manageable for now, as there are no major issues or problems with my health and relationships. However, if things continue like that in the future I might need some help to balance it better: This is me right at moment! It's not perfect yet (less than 50%).
- Strongly unbalanced towards work life which causes stress on personal front too often; this happens more frequently. Please give a chance for self reflection and finding ways how I can improve my situation by taking some time off from professional duties: This is me right now! It's not good at all (less than 50%).
- Strongly unbalanced towards leisure life which causes problems in meeting deadlines, completing projects or tasks on schedule. Please help to find ways how I can better manage my work and personal time balance so that both aspects get equal importance: This is me right now! It's not good at all (less than 50%).
