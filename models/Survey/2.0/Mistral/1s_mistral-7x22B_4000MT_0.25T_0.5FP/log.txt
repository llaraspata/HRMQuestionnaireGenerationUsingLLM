    - Good at it (5)
     1. My manager is able when giving critical yet positive comments about my work, making sure to highlight areas for improvement while also acknowledging the things I did well once or twice in three months but not always though... It's important! 2-3 times per year this happens

[LLM ANSWER]
**How satisfied are you with your current career? (Please rate it from the following options)**
- Very Satisfied
- Somewhat satisifed
- Neither happy nor unhappy about my job, but I would like to change some things. This is not a bad place for me right now and there's room of improvement though! It could be better with certain changes in responsibilities or work environment etc.. But it can also stay as good too if those aspects are kept same
- Somewhat dissatisfied, but I am willing to change my career path. However the reason behind this is not because job itself rather something else like working hours and commuting time which makes me feel uncomfortable sometimes due its long duration or maybe salary that doesn't meet expectations etc.. But if those things were addressed then it would be fine
- Very dissatisfied, I am actively looking for a new career path. The reason behind this is not just one thing but multiple factors like work environment and colleagues; responsibilities which do no align with my values or skills set required doesn't match mine etc.. So yes very unhappy about current situation! 
**Do you feel that your job matches well to the rest of who are? (Please rate it from following options)**
- Strongly agree, I am in perfect fit for this role and organization. It feels like everything has been designed just right so as soon as step into shoes they stick perfectly without any adjustments needed at all! 
- Agree: This job is a good match with me but there might be some small things which could make it better such that I would feel more comfortable or satisfied if only those were addressed then everything else falls in place. But overall this position matches well to my personality and skills set required for success too..! 
- Neither agree nor disagree: This job is neither good match not bad either, just neutral about whole concept of matching career path with person itself because it's hard sometimes tell whether someone will succeed even though they seem perfect on paper or in reality. But still there are chances to become great fit if certain conditions met!
- Somewhat Disagree: This job is somewhat match but not exactly what I was looking for, so some adjustments could be made either by changing responsibilities slightly OR giving more autonomy over decisions which would make me feel happier and engaged in position. But still this role has potential to become great fit with little effort!
- Strongly disagree: This job is definitely NOT match at all no matter how hard I try, it just doesn't work out for some reason even though everything else seems fine like skills set or personality traits etc.. So yes strongly feel that not a good career path choice. 
**Do you think your current role provides enough opportunities to learn and grow? (Please rate)**
- Strongly agree: Yes, this job has provided ample opportunity for growth both personally as well professionally through various training programs or workshops which helped me expand my knowledge base significantly beyond what was expected initially! So yes strongly feel that there are plenty of chances available here. 
- Agree : This role does provide enough opportunities but could be better if only certain aspects were addressed like providing more autonomy over decisions, allowing to work from home occasionally or having clear career path within organization which would help me see where I am going and how long it will take for reaching there too! But still agree that learning is possible here.
- Neither Agree nor disagree: This role neither provides enough opportunities not lacks them either because sometimes its hard tell whether someone can learn from certain situation or position, but if only given chance then definitely would be able to pick up new skills and abilities which could make me even better employee in future! 
- Somewhat Disagree : While this job does provide some learning it's not quite enough for my needs as I am always looking forward towards expanding horizons by taking on challenging tasks or projects that push limits of comfort zone. But still there are chances available here if only given opportunity to prove myself and showcase what capable doing!
- Strongly disagree: No, this job does NOT provide any opportunities at all for learning new things because it's just not right fit from beginning due various reasons like lack of resources or support needed succeeding in role. So yes strongly feel that there are no chances here to become better person and employee too..!
**Do you think your current career path is sustainable? (Please rate)** 
- Strongly agree: Yes, this job feels very stable with good prospects for future as well because it matches my skills set perfectly which makes me confident about its sustainability. So yes strongly feel that there are no issues in near term or long run regarding how things will go on!

[LLM ANSWER]
 **On a scale from 1-5, how would you rate your current leader’s effectiveness in their role as manager (within the context of this company)? Please provide specific examples if possible.**
   - Very poor: I have serious concerns about my boss' ability to lead and manage. They do not seem able or willing to listen effectively; they may be too controlling, unaware that a different approach is needed for each situation/person (1) 
   	- Poor: My leader has some issues with their management style but there are signs of improvement on the horizon - I believe my boss will get better if given time and support. They might struggle to adapt in certain situations or when managing specific people, however they do have potential as a manager within this company (2)
   	- Average: My leader is neither good nor bad at their job; there are some positive aspects but also areas where my boss could improve - I think with the right support and guidance from HR/higher management that we can help them become more effective in managing people, projects or processes. (3)
   	- Good: My leader is a competent manager who has good relationships within their team; they are able to provide necessary resources for success but could still improve on certain aspects of communication and empathy - I think with some training from HR/higher management we can help them become even better (4)
   	- Very Good: My leader is an excellent manager who knows how best manage people, projects or processes; they are able to provide necessary resources for success while also being a great communicator and empathetic towards their team. I believe my boss has the ability not only maintain this level of performance but improve further with support from HR/higher management (5)
   	- Exceptional: My leader is an exceptional manager who knows how best manage people, projects or processes; they are able to provide necessary resources for success while also being a great communicator and empathetic towards their team. I believe my boss has the ability not only maintain this level of performance but improve further with support from HR/higher management (6)
   	- Unsure: Not sure about leader's effectiveness in managing people, projects or processes; they may be a new manager who needs time to adjust and learn how best manage their team. I believe that my boss can become an effective manager if given the right support from HR/higher management (7)

[LLM ANSWER]
 **On a scale from 1-5, how would you rate your overall experience with our company's new employee orientation program (onboarding)? Please provide specific reasons for the rating.**
 - Strongly disagree: I did not like it at all. The process was confusing and unhelpful; strongly agree: It could hardly have been better! 5 stars, no doubt about that... :)
- Neutral/Undecided (if you don't know or can’t decide) – If this is your answer please provide more information on why it wasn’t possible to make a decision. Were there some things missing? Was the process unclear at times and hard for understanding, making evaluation difficult
- Strongly agree: I really liked how we were treated as new employees; agreed with everything that was presented in orientation program! 5 stars from me :) - Agree (if you like it but have a few minor issues) – Generally positive about the onboarding process. There are some things to improve, however most of them could be easily fixed and would make this experience perfect for everyone
- Somewhat agree: I liked how we were treated as new employees; there is still room left before being completely satisfied with everything that was presented in orientation program (3 stars) - Disagree – The onboarding process wasn’t what you expected. You have some suggestions or complaints about it, but not too many and they can be easily fixed
- Strongly disagree: I did NOT like the way we were treated as new employees at all! 1 star from me :( (Strongest dislike) - Somewhat Disagree – The onboarding process wasn’t what you expected. You have some suggestions or complaints about it, and they are quite important to be fixed
- Please provide any additional comments regarding the orientation program for new employees? What did/didn't work well in your opinion; how can we make this experience better next time around so that everyone feels welcome from day one! Thank you very much. 🙂 - Is there anything specific thing missing or unclear about our onboarding process, which should be included to help new employees feel more comfortable and welcomed?
- Were the materials provided clear enough for understanding how things work in this company (either through manuals/guides etc.) – On a scale from 1 -5 please rate your experience with those resources. If you are not sure about something, just let me know! I’m here to help and make onboarding better :).
- Were the people who were responsible for our orientation process helpful enough? (On a scale of 0 – Not at all / To10 - Completely) Please provide specific reasons if possible. Thank you very much, your feedback is important!

    + Other: __________________
    
**Do you feel recognized at work? (Select one)**
  - Yes I do but not always in a positive way or with constructive feedback attached to it, which is important for me too!  	+ Absolutely yes and often through words of appreciation.      No definitely NOT by my employer as they never say thank-you even when you go above & beyond the call
  - Not really because I don't get enough positive reinforcement or recognition from management/colleagues about performance, work ethic etc  	+ It depends on situation and type of task completed. Sometimes yes but not always!      + No way – it feels like my contributions are taken for granted even when they help the company achieve its goals

The work that gets done doesn’t seem valued or recognized by management/colleagues!    + Yes but it could be improved with a better communication process about performance & contributions to the company
  - I think so, as my efforts are seen through various projects at different levels within organization and rewarded appropriately.  	+ Not sure – recognition is not something that has been discussed in detail or evaluated regularly!    + Yes because management provides regular feedback on how well tasks completed which helps me improve & feel valued
  - No I don't, as there seems to be no system for recognizing employees and their contributions at work.  	+ Not really – recognition is not something that gets discussed often in my workplace even when doing good job!    + Yes because management provides regular opportunities for growth within the company & rewards based on performance
  - I don't feel recognized, as it seems like everyone else but me receives praise and appreciation from managers/colleagues.  	+ Not really – recognition is not something that gets discussed often in my workplace even when doing good job!    + Yes because management provides regular opportunities for growth within the company & rewards based on performance

This JSON object represents a questionnaire with four questions. Each question has a unique code, content, type, display order, and a list of possible answers. The four questions are asking about the recognition and rewards system in an organization, and the different types of recognition/rewards that are valued. The questions are asking about the frequency and process of recognition, and why a certain type of recognition/reward system would be ideal. The display order of the questions can be adjusted.
