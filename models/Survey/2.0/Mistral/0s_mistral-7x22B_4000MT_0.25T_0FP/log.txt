Generate me a questionnaire on Manager feedback

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure, I can help you generate a questionnaire on Manager Feedback. Here are some questions that can be used to gather feedback about managers:

1. How would you describe your manager's communication style? Is it clear and concise, or do they tend to be more vague and indirect?
2. Do you feel like your manager's decisions are made with enough consideration for the people who will be affected by them?
3. How well do you feel that your manager understands your job and the challenges you face in your role?
4. Do you feel that your manager sets clear expectations and goals for you and your team?
5. How often do you receive feedback from your manager about your performance? Is it timely and specific, or do you feel like it's too late and too general?
6. Do you feel that your manager creates a positive work environment, or do they tend to create tension and conflict?
7. How well do you feel that your manager is able to handle conflicts and difficult conversations?
8. Do you feel that your manager is able to adapt to changing circumstances and new challenges?
9. How well do you feel that your manager is able to balance the needs of the team with the needs of individual team members?
10. Do you feel that your manager is able to provide the resources and support you need to be successful in your role?

I hope this helps! Let me know if you would like me to convert it into a specified format.

1. How would you rate the training program on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest?
2. Did the training program meet your expectations?
3. Did you feel like the training was relevant to your job and provided you with the skills you need?
4. Were the training materials and methods easy to understand and apply?
5. Was the training engaging and interactive, or did you find it to be boring?
6. Did you feel like the training was the right length, or do you think it could have been shorter or longer?
7. Were there any distractions or obstacles that prevented you from fully participating in the training?
8. Did the training provide you with the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers?
9. Did you feel like the training was inclusive and catered to the needs of all learners?
10. How likely are you to recommend this training program to a colleague?

I hope this questionnaire helps you investigate the effectiveness of a training program. Let me know if you would like me to convert it into a specific format.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure, I can generate a questionnaire on learner feedback after a course session for you. Here are some questions that can be used to gather feedback from learners:

1. How would you rate the overall quality of the course session?
2. Did you find the course content to be relevant and useful for your job or personal growth?
3. Were the learning materials easy to understand and accessible?
4. How well did the course delivery methods (such as lectures, group discussions, and hands-on activities) meet your needs?
5. Were the instructors knowledgeable and able to explain complex topics in an easy-to-understand manner?
6. How would you rate the level of interaction and engagement with other learners during the course session?
7. Did you feel that the course duration and schedule were appropriate, or did you feel rushed or that there was too much time?
8. Were the assessment methods (such as quizzes, tests, and projects) fair and effective in measuring your understanding of the course material?
9. How well did the course accommodate learners with different learning styles and needs?
10. Is there anything you would like to see changed or improved in future course sessions?

Please let me know if you would like me to convert this questionnaire into a specific format.

2. If they have ever felt like they were on a 'dead-end' job with no opportunity for advancement.
3. How often they feel like they have the resources and support they need to achieve their career goals.
4. If they know what skills and qualifications they need to move up in their career.
5. If they have ever felt like they were not able to get a promotion or raise because of lack of career path clarity.
6. If they have a clear understanding of the promotion and career advancement opportunities within the company.
7. If they have ever felt like they were in a 'job-hopping' cycle, with no clear career path within the company.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure, I can help you generate a questionnaire on Internal Mobility Opportunities. Here are some questions that can be used to gather information about internal mobility opportunities within a company:

1. Does your company have a formal process for internal mobility, or do employees have to find opportunities themselves?
2. How many internal mobility opportunities are available each year, and in which departments?
3. Are there any specific criteria that employees need to meet to be considered for internal mobility, such as tenure or performance metrics?
4. Does the company provide resources such as training or mentoring to help employees prepare for a new role?
5. How is an employee's previous role and responsibilities considered when they move to a new position? Are they able to build upon their past experiences?
6. What is the process for filling open positions with internal candidates, and how is this decision made?
7. Are there any barriers to internal mobility, such as manager resistance or lack of resources?
8. How is the compensation for the new role determined, and are there any guarantees for internal candidates?
9. Does the company have a culture of internal mobility, and how is this promoted?
10. How does the company measure the success of internal mobility, and are there any metrics in place?

I hope this questionnaire will help you gather the information you need about internal mobility opportunities within your company. Let me know if you would like me to convert it into a specific format.

This is a JSON object that represents a survey about job satisfaction. The survey has 10 questions, and each question has a unique code, display order, and type (either 1 or 3). The questions are about job satisfaction, and the possible answers are 1 (strongly agree), 2 (somewhat agree), 3 (somewhat disagree), and 4 (strongly disagree).

To make it easier to analyze, I would like to convert this JSON object into a CSV file with the following format:
code,display order,type,answer
"JSAT_Q1",1,3,1
"JSAT_Q2",2,3,2
"JSAT_Q3",3,3,3
"JSAT_Q4",4,3,4
"JSAT_Q5",5,3,1
"JSAT_Q6",6,3,2
"JSAT_Q7",7,3,3
"JSAT_Q8",8,3,4
"JSAT_Q9",9,3,1
"JSAT_Q10",10,3,2

The CSV file would have 4 columns: code, display order, type, and answer. The code column would contain the unique code for each question, the display order column would contain the display order, the type column would contain either 1 or 3 depending on the type of the question, and the answer column would contain the answer to that question.

Here is the code to convert the JSON object into a CSV file:

import json

# Read the JSON object from a file or a string
json_object = json.loads('{"survey":{"version":"1.0.0", "responses":{"response1":{"variables":[{"name":"Q01","label":"How satisfied are you with the opportunities for growth and advancement in your job?","values":{"1":"Strongly agree","2":"Somewhat agree","3":"Somewhat disagree","4":"Strongly disagree"}},"question":{"text":"How satisfied are you with the opportunities for growth and advancement in your job?","required":true,"type":3},"answer":{"text":"Somewhat agree","variable":{"name":"Q01"}}},"response2":{"variables":[{"name":"Q02","label":"How satisfied are you with the salary and benefits package in your job?","values":{"1":"Strongly agree","2":"Somewhat agree","3":"Somewhat disagree","4":"Strongly disagree"}},"question":{"text":"How satisfied are you with the salary and benefits package in your job?","required":true,"type":3},"answer":{"text":"Somewhat agree","variable":{"name":"Q02"}}},"response3":{"variables":[{"name":"Q03","label":"How satisfied are you with the work-life balance in your job?","values":{"1":"Strongly agree","2":"Somewhat agree","3":"Somewhat disagree","4":"Strongly disagree"}},"question":{"text":"How satisfied are you with the work-life balance in your job?","required":true,"type":3},"answer":{"text":"Somewhat agree","variable":{"name":"Q03"}}}},"response4":{"variables":[{"name":"Q04","label":"How satisfied are you with the physical work environment in your job?","values":{"1":"Strongly agree","2":"Somewhat agree","3":"Somewhat disagree","4":"Strongly disagree"}},"question":{"text":"How satisfied are you with the physical work environment in your job?","required":true,"type":3},"answer":{"text":"Somewhat agree","variable":{"name":"Q04"}}}},"response5":{"variables":[{"name":"Q05","label":"How satisfied are you with the culture in your organization?","values":{"1":"Strongly agree","2":"Somewhat agree","3":"Somewhat disagree","4":"Strongly disagree"}},"question":{"text":"How satisfied are you with the culture in your organization?","required":true,"type":3},"answer":{"text":"Somewhat agree","variable":{"name":"Q05"}}},"response6":{"variables":[{"name":"Q06","label":"How satisfied are you with the communication in your organization?","values":{"1":"Strongly agree","2":"Somewhat agree","3":"Somewhat disagree","4":"Strongly disagree"}},"question":{"text":"How satisfied are you with the communication in your organization?","required":true,"type":3},"answer":{"text":"Somewhat agree","variable":{"name":"Q06"}}},"response7":{"variables":[{"name":"Q07","label":"How satisfied are you with the learning opportunities in your job?","values":{"1":"Strongly agree","2":"Somewhat agree","3":"Somewhat disagree","4":"Strongly disagree"}},"question":{"text":"How satisfied are you with the learning opportunities in your job?","required":true,"type":3},"answer":{"text":"Somewhat agree","variable":{"name":"Q07"}}},"response8":{"variables":[{"name":"Q08","label":"How satisfied are you with the performance of your direct supervisor?","values":{"1":"Strongly agree","2":"Somewhat agree","3":"Somewhat disagree","4":"Strongly disagree"}},"question":{"text":"How satisfied are you with the performance of your direct supervisor?","required":true,"type":3},"answer":{"text":"Somewhat agree","variable":{"name":"Q08"}}},"response9":{"variables":[{"name":"Q09","label":"How satisfied are you with the performance of your organization?","values":{"1":"Strongly agree","2":"Somewhat agree","3":"Somewhat disagree","4":"Strongly disagree"}},"question":{"text":"How satisfied are you with the performance of your organization?","required":true,"type":3},"answer":{"text":"Somewhat agree","variable":{"name":"Q09"}}},"response10":{"variables":[{"name":"Q10","label":"How satisfied are you with your job in general?","values":{"1":"Strongly agree","2":"Somewhat agree","3":"Somewhat disagree","4":"Strongly disagree"}},"question":{"text":"How satisfied are you with your job in general?","required":true,"type":3},"answer":{"text":"Somewhat agree","variable":{"name":"Q10"}}},"questions":[{"code":"Q01","text":"How satisfied are you with the opportunities for growth and advancement in your job?","required":true,"type":3},{"code":"Q02","text":"How satisfied are you with the salary and benefits package in your job?","required":true,"type":3},{"code":"Q03","text":"How satisfied are you with the work-life balance in your job?","required":true,"type":3},{"code":"Q04","text":"How satisfied are you with the physical work environment in your job?","required":true,"type":3},{"code":"Q05","text":"How satisfied are you with the culture in your organization?","required":true,"type":3},{"code":"Q06","text":"How satisfied are you with the communication in your organization?","required":true,"type":3},{"code":"Q07","text":"How satisfied are you with the learning opportunities in your job?","required":true,"type":3},{"code":"Q08","text":"How satisfied are you with the performance of
