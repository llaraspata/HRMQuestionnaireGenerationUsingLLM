[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of ten engaging and thought-provoking questions about end of working relationships:

---Questionaire for Understanding Attitudes Towards Professional Separation—10 Questions----------------------------

As an HR professional, you may be aware that certain team members are experiencing the termination or transition out of their roles. To better understand how this impacts your workforce and to create a more empathetic environment in which people can part ways with dignity; we would like our employees’ opinions on these matters:

1. How do they feel about being informed face-to-face that someone is leaving the company? 	Do you think it's important for everyone involved, or should only managers and HR personnel be responsible to deliver this message personally? What are your thoughts regarding using technology (email/video call) vs in person conversations when communicating such news about end of working relationship with a colleague that they have worked closely together before the separation takes place.
2. When someone is let go, do you think it's important to share reasons for their termination? Or should this information be kept confidential due to potential legal issues or because people might become defensive and not learn from others’ mistakes if shared publicly within a team setting (even anonymously)? 	Please elaborate on your thoughts.
3. How do you feel about the concept of "exit interviews"? Do they serve any purpose other than making HR teams look like detectives trying to find out what happened? Or can these conversations be used as learning tools for both parties involved, including those who will continue working together after someone has left their team or company permanently due end-of work relationship reasons.
4. If you were in charge of designing a perfect farewell event/ceremony when people leave your organization because they are no longer needed (not laid off) but still want to show appreciation for all the good things that person brought into lives and minds, how would this celebration look like? Would it include everyone or just those directly affected by their absence due end of working relationship reasons.
5. In what ways do you think companies can better support employees who are leaving them because they no longer fit in with organizational goals/culture etc., so that these individuals feel supported during the transition period and beyond, even if it means helping find another job? 	Please share your thoughts on this topic as well!
6. Have any of you ever experienced a situation where someone was let go without being given enough time to say goodbye or prepare emotionally for such change in their life due end-of working relationship reasons - and how did that make YOU feel about it, not the person who left but rather your own feelings? 	Please elaborate.
7. If you were tasked with creating a list of "10 Commandments" to be followed by all managers when terminating someone's contract due end-of work relationship reasons - what would those rules look like in YOUR opinion, based on experience and knowledge about people management best practices? 	Please share your thoughts.
8. In today’s fast paced business environment where change is constant – how do YOU feel that companies should approach the concept of "job security" for their employees who are not considered essential anymore but still want to maintain positive work relationships with them after they leave due end-of working relationship reasons? 	Please elaborate on your thoughts.
9. In a situation when someone has been let go and you're left wondering whether it was the right decision or if there were other options available, how can HR teams support those who still have jobs in understanding why this happened to their colleague - without creating an atmosphere of fear around job security? 	Please share your thoughts.
10. Finally – do YOU believe that people should be given second chances within organizations they've been a part before and left due end-of work relationship reasons, or is it better for everyone involved if such individuals never return to the company again after being let go once already? 	Please elaborate on your thoughts about this topic.

Generate me a questionnaire on Manager feedback with 3 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! I can generate a set of three manager feedback-related questions for you in an interesting way:

1) On a scale of 0-10, how satisfied are you currently with the overall performance and effectiveness of your direct reports? Please provide specific examples or reasons to support this score. (Rating Scale Question)
2) If given power over someone else's promotion in terms of position/title change within our company - would YOU promote them based on what they have demonstrated thus far, yes OR no ? And why do you feel that way about it? Binary Choice with Explanation Statement. (Binary choice question including explanation statement for the answer)
3) In your opinion: Is there a specific person or group of people who could benefit from additional training and development opportunities in order to become more effective managers themselves someday, yes OR no ? And if so - which individuals/departments do you think would most likely see positive results after receiving this type-of coaching? Please specify them clearly. (Binary choice question including explanation statement for the answer)

I hope these questions will be helpful in collecting manager feedback! Let me know, and I can generate more if needed or convert it into a specified format like text/email etc..

2. What specific skills or talents stand out the most when it comes to their future growth? Please rank top 3 with justification for each one!

Generate me a questionnaire on Course feedback with 5 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a course feedback survey in five questions:

1. On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate the overall quality of this course? Please provide your rating and any comments about what specifically worked or didn't work for you.
2. How well did the learning materials (such as readings, slides, videos) support your understanding of each topic in the course? Were there certain resources that stood out to you positively or negatively? Share a few details if possible!
3. Did this course challenge and stretch your thinking about its subject matter? If not completely satisfied with my answer choice here... I would encourage sharing specific examples where more challenging activities could be integrated into the curriculum for future students like yourself :)
4. Were you able to apply what was taught in class directly back at work or other areas of life outside this course setting (if applicable)? Please elaborate on your response if possible! This will help us understand how well our content is translating from theory-to practice... 5) If given the chance, would YOU take another version/iteration with similar topics covered again in future? Why yes or no?!
6. Is there anything else you'd like to share about this course that could improve it for others who might enroll after reading your comments and feedback here today - whether big picture thoughts OR specific anecdotes from personal experience! We want everyone feeling encouraged, supported & motivated throughout their learning journey so they can get maximum value out of each class.
7. Thank you very much!!

Generate me a questionnaire on Access to Technology and Tools with 9 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of nine engaging questions about access to technology and tools:

1) How would you rate your overall level of agreement that all employees have equal access to necessary technologies and tools? (Strongly agree, somewhat agree, neutral, strongly disagree or don't know.) Can you share any specific examples where this has been a problem for someone in the company? If so, how did it affect their productivity/happiness at work.
2) Do employees have access to all necessary tools and technology required by job description (Yes / No)? Please elaborate on why or why not if possible! 🤓 Is there any room left for improvement here in your opinion? If yes, what would that look like exactly - a more detailed explanation will be appreciated.
3) In terms of physical space/equipment availability: Are all employees able to comfortably use their assigned technology and tools without feeling cramped or sharing too much with others (Yes / No)? 🤓 If not, what could change in order for everyone's needs met? For instance - having a dedicated tech support person available on-site might help!
4) How do you feel about the current state of technology and tools being up to date at your company: Do they seem modern or outdated compared with competitors (Yes / No)? Please provide specific examples if possible. 🤓 If yes, how does this affect employee morale/productivity? And what could be done differently here so that people feel proud using these resources rather than feeling embarrassed because of them!
5) In terms of training: Are all employees adequately trained on the technology and tools they need to perform their jobs effectively (Yes / No)? 🤓 If not, how can this issue addressed? Is there a way for everyone's needs met without overwhelming others with too much information at once.
6) Can you tell me if any employees have expressed concerns about safety or security regarding technology and tools used in your company recently (Yes / No)? 🤓 If yes, what were those specific issues? How did management respond to them - was it handled well/badly etcetera! And how can this situation improved moving forward.
7) Do you think there are enough resources available for employees who want or need additional training on certain technologies and tools (Yes / No)? 🤓 If not, what could be done differently here so that everyone's needs met without overwhelming others with too much information at once - perhaps a more tailored approach might work better.
8) Is there an open communication channel between employees who need something from the IT department and those responsible for providing it (Yes / No)? 🤓 If not, how can this situation improved moving forward? Perhaps setting up regular meetings or check-ins could help! And if yes - are these communications handled well/badly etcetera.
9) Finally: Can you tell me whether all employees feel comfortable asking for what they need from the IT department (Yes / No)? 🤓 If not, how can this situation improved moving forward? Is there a way to make people more confident in expressing their needs without feeling like it's an imposition.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of ten engaging questions about career path clarity:

Question 1: How clear are you in terms of understanding where different job roles within the company might lead to? (5-point scale)
 Question 2: Do you feel that your current role aligns with long term goals or not, and why is this so for you personally? Please elaborate.
 Question 3: Is there a clear career path defined in terms of steps required before reaching certain positions within the company - yes/no answer will suffice! If "yes", please specify what those are to help us understand better as well :) . Otherwise, do tell why this is not possible at present time for you.
 Question 4: How often have YOU received information about potential career paths and their requirements from your supervisors or HR? Please use a scale of frequency (1 being never; 5 - always). Include any anecdotes if they come to mind! :) . If it's been rare, do let us know how that has affected you.
 Question 5: Do YOU think there should be more emphasis on defining clear career paths for employees within the company? Please use a scale of agreement (1 being strongly disagree; 3 - neutral). Include any thoughts or feelings here if comfortable doing so! :) . If not, just let us know why this topic feels uncomfortable.
 Question 6: Have you ever felt that your skills and abilities were underutilized in the company? Please use a scale of frequency (1 being never; 5 - always). Include any anecdotes or stories here if they come to mind! :) . If yes, do tell us how it made YOU feel.
 Question 7: Is there someone within your team/department who has inspired you with their career growth and potential? Please use a scale of agreement (1 being strongly disagree; 5 - very much so). Include any thoughts or feelings here if comfortable doing! :) . If not, just let us know why this topic feels uncomfortable.
 Question 8: How often do YOU get to discuss your future within the company with supervisors? Please use a scale of frequency (1 being never; 5 - always) and include anecdotes or stories if you feel comfortable doing so! :) . If it's been rare, please share how that has affected YOUR motivation.
 Question 9: Do YOU think there should be more opportunities for career growth within the company? Please use a scale of agreement (1 being strongly disagree; 5 - very much agree). Include any thoughts or feelings here if comfortable doing so! :) . If not, just let us know why this topic feels uncomfortable.
 Question 10: Have you ever felt that your potential was capped due to lack of opportunities for career growth? Please use a scale of frequency (1 being never; 5 - always). Include any anecdotes or stories here if comfortable doing so! :) . If yes, do tell us how it made YOU feel.

[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of seven engaging questions about career path clarity:
1. Can you describe how clear or unclear it feels what steps should be taken next in terms of your professional development? Please rate this feeling using the scale from "completely certain" to "absolutely clueless".
2. Do you feel that there is a well-defined career path within our company, and do YOU personally fit into it with specific roles or levels identified for yourself as stepping stones towards success in your role? Please elaborate on this answer if possible!
3. Is the concept of "career ladder" something familiar to both management AND employees at all organizational tiers OR only upper echelons have a clear vision about their future steps and growth opportunities available within our company culture, or not present yet but planned for implementation? Please share your thoughts with us on this matter!
4. How often do you get an opportunity (or even feel encouraged) to discuss career paths during performance evaluations OR other formal/informal meetings - is it a frequent topic of conversation and actionable steps are taken, or not at all present in the organizational culture? Please rate your agreement with this statement on scale from "never" till 'constantly".
5. Do you feel that there's enough information available about career paths within our company OR do we need to work more towards transparency and openness regarding growth opportunities, or is it a topic which needs improvement in terms of communication? Please share your thoughts! 6. Can YOU identify any barriers preventing people from understanding their own potential for professional development AND if yes - what are those obstacles that keep employees unaware about how they can grow within our organization and reach higher positions through learning new skills, or not present yet but planned to be implemented in the near future?
7. And finally: do you feel like there is a clear understanding of who YOU ARE as an employee AND where your place on this "career ladder" might fit best OR it's still unclear and needs further exploration both from YOUR side, management or even organizational culture perspective - please share!

Generate me a questionnaire on Feedback Mechanisms with 6 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a feedback mechanisms questionnaire in plain text form:
```vbnet
1) On a scale from 1-5, how satisfied are you currently with the current feedback mechanism? (Please specify whether it's about speed of receiving and providing feedback or quality.)
2) Do you think that our company has an effective way to collect both positive AND negative employee opinions without making anyone feel uncomfortable in any situation at all times during work hours only if yes then mark 5 else otherwise mention the number. (Please specify whether it's about anonymousness, frequency of feedback or something specific.)
3) Is there a possibility for everyone who wants and needs to give/receive constructive criticism without hesitation? If not which barriers are coming in way like lack of training on how giving effective critical comments can be made more comfortable. (Please specify whether it's about accessibility, anonymity or something specific.)
4) Do you feel that our current feedback system is helping people grow and evolve personally as well professionally? If not then please suggest improvements in detail like what type of training do they need to make them understand the importance. (Please specify whether it's about format/content, impact on performance or something specific.)
5) How often are you receiving feedback that is actionable enough for YOU and others around so as everyone can improve themselves? If not then please suggest improvements in detail like what type of training do they need to make them understand the importance. (Please specify whether it's about frequency, relevance or something specific.)
6) Can our current system handle both formal structured feedback along with informal spontaneous one-on-one conversations without any issues? If not then please suggest improvements in detail like what type of training do they need to make them understand the importance. (Please specify whether it's about format/content, flexibility or something specific.)

2) Have you ever felt that certain people or teams within the organization receive more attention in terms of receiving constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement than others do? If yes, who are they and why is this happening according to YOU? (50 words max per person/team mentioned).
3a) Imagine a world where everyone had access to your thoughts about them. How would you feel if there was no filter or limit on how often people could give feedback in that society - both positive & negative, including the impact of such an environment for YOU? (50 words max per person/team mentioned).
3b) If given a chance and resources required to implement your ideal frequency range regarding providing constructive criticism within our company culture: What would be this optimal number or percentage in order not only maintain but also enhance team collaboration, productivity & overall satisfaction among employees including YOURSELF? (50 words max per person/team mentioned).
4) In a perfect world where all feedback was given anonymously and without any repercussions for those giving it: What would be the top 3 areas of improvement you'd like to see addressed by our organization, in order not only maintain but also enhance team collaboration & overall satisfaction? (50 words max per area mentioned).
Assuming we can convert this questionnaire into a specified format - such as text or even speech: Would it make any difference for YOU and others if the questions were presented with more visuals like graphs, charts etc. instead of just plain texts in order to increase understanding & engagement level? (50 words max per person/team mentioned).
Please let me know whether you need further assistance!

[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a health and safety measures themed questionnaire in plain text:

1. How often do you think about the cleanliness of high-touch surfaces such as door handles, elevator buttons, or keyboards? *Strongly agree* to never disagree that it's important for preventing illnesses from spreading around your workplace and home environments! (5 point scale) 2 - This question is a little more specific: how often do you wash/disinfect high-touch surfaces at work with soap, detergent or another cleaning agent? *Always* would be the best answer to keep everyone safe.
3. In your opinion what should an ideal office temperature range for comfort and productivity in summer months (June - August) versus winter season(December – February)? Please select from these ranges: 65-70F, 71-78 F or above/below this! And why?
4. How do you feel about the placement of hand sanitizer stations around your office and home environments (please choose one option): *Strongly agree* that they should be placed in every corner to make it easier for everyone, including visitors who don't have their own bottle with them! 2 - Neutral.
5. How do you feel about the placement of hand sanitizer stations around your office and home environments (please choose one option): *Strongly agree* that they should be placed in every corner to make it easier for everyone, including visitors who don't have their own bottle with them! 2 - Neutral.
6. How do you feel about the placement of hand sanitizer stations around your office and home environments (please choose one option): *Strongly agree* that they should be placed in every corner to make it easier for everyone, including visitors who don't have their own bottle with them! 2 - Neutral.
7. In the past month how many times did you take a break from screens and electronics during your workday? *Always at least once* would be ideal because of eye strain prevention but also to give brain some rest too, please select one option: Always less than twice per week; 2-3 days in that timeframe or more often.
8. Do you feel comfortable with the current ventilation system and air quality inside your office? *Strongly agree* would mean it's perfect for health comfort but also productivity! Please choose from these options: Always, Sometimes not sure if enough fresh outside air is circulating around; Not at all – need improvement in this area.
9. How do you feel about the current ventilation system and indoor quality of your office? *Strongly agree* that it should be a priority for health comfort but also productivity! Please choose from these options: Always, Sometimes not sure if enough fresh outside air is circulating around; Not at all – need improvement in this area.
10. How do you feel about the current ventilation system and indoor quality of your office? *Strongly agree* that it should be a priority for health comfort but also productivity!

 Sure! Here is a set of eight engaging and variedquestions about internal mobility opportunities within a company:

1. If you had the chance, which department would you like to work in next? Why did you choose this one?
2. Have you ever been offered an opportunity for promotion or lateral move inside your current organization? What factors influenced your decision whether to accept it or not?
3. In terms of career growth and development within a company: On a scale from 1-5, how would rate the availability of internal mobility opportunities in this firm (with five being "very easy" for employees)? Please elaborate on why you chose that number!
4. How do YOU feel about people who have been promoted several times internally? Is it positive or negative to see them climbing up through different roles and departments, while staying within the same company walls?! Or maybe there is a hidden reason behind this phenomenon... Share your thoughts with us :) !!!!!!5. Have you ever felt that internal mobility opportunities are not available for everyone equally in our organization - but only some "favorites" get them? If yes: who and why do YOU think they got those chances?!
6. In a perfect world, how would TOP MANAGEMENT look like to make all employees feel comfortable about their future career growth within the company (and not looking for another job)?! Share your vision with us - it can be as crazy or realistic you want :) !!!!!!7. If YOU could design an internal mobility program in our organization, what would that system include? What are YOUR TOP-3 MUST HAVEs to make this initiative successful?!
8. How do we feel about people who leave the company after being promoted and getting a taste of "better life" outside - is it positive or negative for you personally if they come back in 5 years with new skills, knowledge & experience? Share your thoughts on that! :) !!!!!!

Generate me a questionnaire on Leadership Effectiveness with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of seven engaging and thought-provoking questions about leadership effectiveness:
1) How would you rate the overall vision and direction setting ability of this leader? Is it clear, concise, inspiring, and well communicated to all team members? Please select one answer from 0 (not effective at all) to 5 (extremely effective). If not sure or unable to evaluate – please write N/A.
2) Does the identified vision align with your values as a person in this organization? Is it something that you can get behind and support wholeheartedly, even if there are some bumps along the way during implementation of said strategy (yes / no)? If not sure or unable to evaluate – please write N/A.
3) How well does our leader listen actively when receiving feedback from team members? Is it clear that they care about your thoughts and feelings as a person, even if there are disagreements on certain topics at times - yes (absolutely), no(not really)? If not sure or unable to evaluate – please write N/A.
4) How well does our leader adapt their communication style based upon the audience? Can they switch from technical jargon and big-picture visionary mode into a more detailed, hands on approach when needed - yes (absolutely), no(not really)? If not sure or unable to evaluate – please write N/A.
5) Does our leader create an environment of psychological safety for all team members? Is it clear that everyone can speak up and share their thoughts without fearing negative consequences, even if they are different from the leaders - yes (absolutely), no(not really)? If not sure or unable to evaluate – please write N/A.
6) How well does our leader motivate others in a team? Is it clear that people feel empowered and encouraged by their actions on daily basis, even when facing challenges together as one unit - yes (absolutely), no(not really)? If not sure or unable to evaluate – please write N/A.
7) How well does our leader delegate tasks within the organization in a way which makes sense? Is it clear that people feel they have been given just enough responsibility and freedom, while still being held accountable for their actions - yes (absolutely), no(not really)?

Please note that this JSON object contains a survey about whether people feel like they have to change certain aspects of themselves in order to be successful at work. Each question is represented by a unique "CODE", and the answer options are stored in the "_TF\_ANSWERS" property. The "DISPLAY\_ORDER" property is used to determine the order in which the questions should be displayed.

To convert this JSON object into a format that can be used to generate a survey, you can use the following JavaScript code:
```
const survey = [];
for (const question of Object.values(jsonObject)) {
  survey.push({
    type: "MultipleChoice",
    key: question.CODE,
    text: question.NAME,
    choices: question["_TF_ANSWERS"].map((option, index) => ({
      value: index === 0 ? "True" : index.toString(),
      text: option
    }))
  });
}
```
This code will create a survey array that contains objects with the necessary information to generate the survey. The "MultipleChoice" type indicates that the question is a multiple choice question, and the "key" property is used to uniquely identify each question. The "text" property contains the question text, and the "choices" property is an array of objects that contains the answer options. The "value" property is used to determine which answer is selected, and the "text" property contains the actual answer option text.

Here is the survey array that will be used to generate the survey:
```

Generate me a questionnaire on Recognition and Rewards with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of seven engaging and varied questions about recognition and rewards:
1) In our organization, how often do you think employees should be recognized for their good work? Is there such thing as too much or not enough recognition? Please specify.
2) How can we make sure that the recognition given to an employee is meaningful and impactful rather than just a routine task? What would it take to instill sincerity in this process?
3) Can you share some examples of non-monetary rewards which have been successful within your organization, or any place else for creating positive reinforcement among employees. How can we make sure that these methods are inclusive and do not exclude anyone from the benefits they offer? 
4) In a survey conducted by Gallup in collaboration with Tom Rauthers State University of New York at Plattsburgh (SUNY), it was found out that only around two elements or factors contribute to creating an engaged employee. How can we ensure these conditions are met for all our employees and not just some?
5) In your opinion, what role does feedback play in recognition programs within a company setting; is there any connection between the frequency of providing constructive criticism/feedback with engagement levels among team members or departments as whole ? 6. What do you think about recognizing people based on their performance rather than just effort? Is it fair to judge someone only by results they produce and not include other factors such as how well received those outcomes are, into the equation of recognition system design for employees in your organization
7) How can we make sure that our rewards program is equitable across all levels within an organisation. Can you share any insights about making it a fair process where everyone has equal opportunity to be recognised and rewarded?

Generate me a questionnaire on Roadmap planning feedback with 5 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of five engaging questions about roadmaps and their effectiveness:

1) On a scale from "Not at all" (0) to "Extremely well"(10), how would you rate the alignment between your team's objectives, projects in progress, and overall company goals? Please provide specific examples if any.
2) If there was an opportunity for improvement regarding roadmap planning within a particular department or cross-functionally; what area do think needs more attention to make it better aligned with other teams/departments’ plans (either technical / nontechnical)? And why is that? Please share your thoughts and ideas.
3) In the past, have you ever felt like certain projects were not given enough time or resources because they didnt fit into a specific roadmap cycle even though it was beneficial for company growth in long term - if yes then which ones specifically ? This will help us understand how people perceive value of different initiatives.
4) When sharing the same space as another team on their journey, have you ever felt that there were conflicts or miscommunications due to lack of clear roadmap? If so please provide details about those situations and what could be done differently next time around ? This will help us identify areas where we can improve communication between teams.
5) Do think it's important for every team member including decision makers, managers etc.,to have a basic understanding how their work fits into larger picture of company roadmap? Why or why not in your opinion please share detailed explanation so that everyone understands importance and relevance clearly . This will help us understand if there is need to improve awareness about our own as well other teams' contributions.
Please let me know whether you want any changes made before converting this into a specified format!

Generate me a questionnaire on Smart working with 6 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of six engaging and interactive questions about smart working:

1. On a scale of 1-5, how satisfied are you currently with using technology tools for work? Please provide your answer verbally or through an emoji (e.g., "3" or ":grinning:"). If the number is low, what steps can be taken to improve it and make smart working more enjoyable?
2. Imagine that all of a sudden you are unable to access any technology tools for work - how would this impact your productivity in terms of hours lost before finding an alternative solution (e.g., "I think I'd lose 4-5 productive hours") ? Please share the reasons behind it and what could be done differently next time!
3. If you had to choose only one technology tool for smart working, which would that BE? And why did this particular option win over others (e.g., "I love Google Drive because...")? This will help us understand your preferences better so we can tailor the environment accordingly in future scenarios too!
4. How often do you feel overwhelmed by information and data streams during a regular workday, on average? Would implementing more intuitive systems make it easier to manage these flows without feeling swamped (e.g., "I usually get overloaded with emails...")? Let's discuss the specific areas where improvements can be made!
5. Think about your most recent project - did you use any collaborative or social software platforms during its completion? If not, why is that and what could have been gained from such tools (e.g., "I wish we had used Slack because...")? Sharing this insight will help us build better teams in the future!
6. Finally: if there was a magic button to make all your work tasks automatically smart-work compatible, would you press it? Why or why not - what concerns do you have about making everything "smart"? This question helps uncover any reservations people might still hold onto regarding this concept and how we can address them effectively!

I hope these questions will help generate valuable insights for your investigation into smart working practices within the company. Let me know if there are specific formats or additional details you would like to see in each response, please just name it - I'm here at Your service ;)

Generate me a questionnaire on Teambuilding initiatives feedback with 6 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of six teambuilding initiative-specific questions in different formats:
1) On a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongely agree), how satisfied are you with the way our team building activities have been organized? Please circle your answer. If it's less than five, what specific actions can we take for improvement and increase this score in future teambuilding events?
2a) Which of these two statements do YOU feel is more important to create a strong bond within the group: 
- Having fun together as much possible or b) Sharing common values/goals. Please select one answer only, but also share why you think this way! (Circle your choice and write down any comments in text boxes).
2b) If sharing common goals is more important to YOU than having FUN - please explain WHY? Is it because shared vision creates a sense of belonging or something else that makes people feel connected. Share as much detail about the reasons behind this answer! (Text box only, no need for circles here :)) 
3a) Do you think we should have more virtual team building events in order to create an even stronger bond between us? Or less - and focus on face-to-face meetings when possible. Again – please choose just one option but elaborate if it's the latter choice! (Circles work here too).
3b) If you chose LESS IN PERSON MEETINGS AND MORE VIRTUAL ONES, can we have some reasons why this might be better for team cohesion and overall success? Or perhaps just personal preference – whatever feels right sharing with us all! (Text box again will suffice).
4) In your opinion: what percentage of time spent on fun activities during teambuilding initiatives is ideal to create a positive atmosphere while still maintaining professionalism necessary for work-related tasks too. Please write down this number in percent format – no need for circles here :)) 5a) On the same scale as before (1 being strongly disagree and five - agree), how much do YOU think TEAM BUILDING initiatives are important to overall success of a company? Again, please circle your answer!
6. And finally: if there was one thing you could change about our teambuilding activities – what would it be in order for them TO BE EVEN BETTER AND MORE EFFECTIVE NEXT TIME ROUND?! (Text box only here).

[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! I'm happy to help you generate a questionnaire about "Training and Development Programs" in an engaging way:

---
Title: Evaluation of the Company’s T&D Initiatives - Quick & Easy Method (QUETAIM) Questionnaire 🎓❇️
1. On a scale of 0-5, how would you rate your overall satisfaction with our Training and Development Program? Please provide specific examples to support this rating! [trainer] The training provided is not only informative but also engaging which makes it easy for participants like me who are visual learners #visuallearner
2. In terms of relevance, how often do you find the topics covered in our T&D sessions applicable and useful? Please specify any particular session that stood out to help us improve! [trainer] I would say 80% because there is always room for improvement but it's important we listen so here are some improvements:
   a. More hands-on activities (not just talking) #handsontopowerful and more focus on real life situations not theoretical ones, this will help us retain information better! [trainer] b. I would like to see an increase in the number of technical skills training sessions as they are essential for my role
3. How frequently do you get a chance or feel motivated enough by our T&D program's content and format? Please share your thoughts on what could make it more appealing! [trainer] The frequency is perfect, but I wish there was an option to choose which sessions we want instead of being assigned randomly #choiceispowerful
4. Do you think that the Training & Development Program has helped in personal growth or not and why? Please provide specific examples if possible for us all learn from your experience! [trainer] Yes, it definitely helps me grow as a person because I can apply new skills learned directly into my work #directimpact
5. If you could change one thing about our T&D program what would that be and why? Please share any thoughts or ideas with us so we all benefit from your wisdom! [trainer] Make the sessions more interactive, for example by using technology to create an immersive experience like virtual reality #technologyispowerful
---
Please note: The above format is a conversational questionnaire and uses "Trainers" perspective. This will help you get better insights about your T&D programs!

[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of eight engaging questions about training and development programs:
1. How would you rate the effectiveness of our current employee training program? Please provide a rating between one (extremely ineffective) to ten (highly effective). Can we have your thoughts on why it received this score, too?! [2-5/7] 💥 RATING TIME!
How do you feel about the accessibility of our training materials? Are they easily available for everyone who needs them or is there still room to improve in terms of availability and convenience (10% chance that it's perfect)? Let me know your thoughts. [7/8] 🏠 Accessible: Yay!
How often do you feel the need to learn something new, but can’t because we don’t have a specific training program? Please provide this frequency in days per week (e.g., if it happens twice then please write "2"). I'm all ears for your answer 🎧!
Considering our current programs and resources available to you, how satisfied are you with them on average out of ten points again?! Let me know the reasons behind this score as well (10% chance that it’s perfect)? Ready? Set. Go!! [7/8] 🌈 Satisfaction: How dope!
Do our training programs cater to all levels within your team, or are they more focused on certain positions and roles than others?! Let me know the percentage of people who feel that their position is represented (5% chance for a "Yes" answer)? I'm listening. [7/8] 🗣️ Communication: Do you think our training programs help in better communication between team members? Please provide your thoughts on this matter, too!
How many hours of learning do YOU need per month to feel comfortable and ready for new challenges?! Let me know the number (e.g., if it's 2 then please write "two"). I promise not to judge you based solely upon that answer :D [7/8] Learning time: How much is enough?
Do our training programs help in better communication between team members, or do they need improvement?! Please share your thoughts on this matter as well (5% chance for a Yes). Let's chat about it!

Generate me a questionnaire on WorkLife Balance with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of seven engaging questions about work-life balance:

1) In order for you to feel satisfied at both work AND home, what percentage of time do YOU think should be dedicated to each? (e.g., 80% work and 20% personal life?) Please provide your answer in a pie chart format! For example:: "50/50"

2) If you could have one superpower that would help maintain better balance between professional AND private spheres, what it be? Describe the power as if giving an action scene movie pitch. Example: A person gains ability to transform time into energy and release bursts of productivity during high-pressure situations! (This is a metaphorical question!)

3) When you think about your work environment - do YOU consider yourself more like "Gardener" or the garden? Please, use only two words in response. Example: If someone enjoys their job and colleagues but feels constantly overwhelmed by external factors then they could say 'garden'. But if a person is not satisfied with current position at all levels (job/colleagues) - that's when we can call them "Gardener".

4) Can you share three things or activities outside of work which help YOU feel rejuvenated and ready for new challenges? Please, use bullet points. Example: 1. Reading novels from diverse genres  2. Listening to podcast about entrepreneurship   3. Playing basketball with friends on weekends

5) If you could swap lives (careers/roles etc.) temporarily or permanently - who would that be and why? Please, use a tweet format in response! Example: "I'd switch places with Elon Musk for just one day because he has the vision & resources to make big changes. #CEOforaday"

6) On scale of 1-5 (where five is maximum), how much do YOU feel that your current work environment supports personal growth and development? Please, use a word cloud format in response! Example: "I'd say it was around '3'. There are opportunities but not as many resources or support from management."

7) Can you name three people (or teams!) at YOUR workplace who inspire YOU to maintain work-life balance. Describe them using only adjectives and no more than 140 characters! Example: "Three amigos of HR team - empathetic, adaptive & empowering #PeopleFirst"

[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of eight engaging and thought-provoking questions about worklife balance:
1. On average, how many hours do you feel like you need for yourself each day to maintain your wellbeing? This could be time spent doing anything – exercising, reading, or just relaxing with family/friends! (0–24) *hours* 🕰️☀
   1. How often are you able to achieve this goal without feeling guilty about not working enough hours on your job? This could be because of a long commute time or simply being too busy with work-related tasks! (0--5, where *3=rarely*, and 4&gt;*often*)
   2. When was the last time you took an entire day off from technology to focus on yourself? This could include not checking emails/texts at all or just putting your phone away for a while! (0--7, where *5=this week*, and 6&gt;*last month*)
   3. How many times per year do you feel like taking an extended break from work is necessary to recharge yourself? This could be anything over three consecutive days off that doesn’t include travel time! (0--4, where *2=rarely*, and 3&gt;*often*)
   1. On a scale of one-to-ten how much do you agree with the statement: “I am satisfied overall when it comes to my work life balance”? Where ten means completely happy! (0--9) +🌡️+➗= *satisfaction score*
   1. How many hours of sleep per night on average would make YOU feel well-rested and ready for the day ahead without any caffeine or other stimulants? This could be anything over six consecutive nights! (0--7) +💤+➗= *sleep score*
   1. When was your last vacation, where you didn’t have to worry about work-related tasks at all and just enjoyed being in the moment with family/friends? This could be anything over three consecutive days off that doesn't include travel time! (0--7) +🏄‍♂️+➗= *vacation score*
   1. In general, how much do you agree or disagree when it comes to your company’s policies regarding work-life balance? This could be anything from flexible working hours and telecommuting options! (0--9) +👍/👎+➗= *agreement score*
Please let me know if there is any other format or information you would like to see in this questionnaire. I am here for YOU 😊

Generate me a questionnaire on WorkLife Balance with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of seven engaging questions about work-life balance:

1. How often do you feel like there's just not enough time in the day for both your job and personal life? (Multiple choice, options could be "Always", "Mostly", or "Rarely")
2. On average, how many hours a week would it take to make YOU feel comfortable with YOUR work-life balance ratio? Please enter number of hour(s). For example: 40h for full time job and rest is covered by personal life activities like hobbies etc... Or if you are working more than that then please specify.
3. Do your current employer's policies about flexible hours, telecommuting or remote work help to maintain a better balance? (Yes/No) If no: Why not?? Is there something specific preventing this from happening and how could it be improved in an ideal world where you are working for that company with perfect flexibility policy.
4. How important is being able to spend quality time outside of the office environment, such as attending a child's soccer game or just having lunch at your favorite place on weekends? (Scale 1-5) If this question was not included in survey and you are reading it now - how would YOU answer based only upon YOUR personal feelings about topic.
5. How often do thoughts of work interfere with time spent relaxing, enjoying hobbies or even just sleeping well because there is still something left unfinished at the end of day? (Multiple choice: "Always", "Mostly" and/or "Rarely") Please provide brief explanation if you selected any other than RARELY.
6. If given an opportunity to work 10% less hours per week but getting paid same salary, would that positively impact your overall life satisfaction? (Yes / No) And why or what is preventing this from happening currently at YOUR workplace and how could it be improved in ideal world where you are working for company with perfect policy.
7. How much do YOU value having a good work-life balance as part of employee benefits package, compared to other things like salary level/benefits? (Scale 1 -5) If this question was not included and reading it now – how would YOUR answer be based only upon personal feelings about topic without looking at any data or research.
Please let me know if you need anything else!

Generate me a questionnaire on Workload Management with 6 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of six engaging questions about workload management:
1) On average, how many hours do you spend each week working? * The goal here isn't just knowing the number but understanding if it leads to burnout or not. If yes then what steps have been taken by individual and organization both in order reduce this burden* 2) How often does your workload feel overwhelming or unmanageable during a typical month (in percentage)? * This question will help us understand how well the person can handle their tasks, as an overwhelmed employee might not be able to give his best.*
3. Have you ever felt that certain projects are being pushed onto YOU rather than team because of lack in resources or manpower? If yes then please specify those areas where more people and tools could have been beneficial * This question will help us understand how well the person can handle their tasks, as an overwhelmed employee might not be able to give his best.*
4. How do you prioritize your work when faced with multiple conflicting deadlines or projects? Please share a recent example if possible! (in 50 words) * This question will help us understand how well the person can handle their tasks, as an overwhelmed employee might not be able to give his best.*
5. How frequently do you need extra time from your manager/supervisor for completing certain projects? If yes then please specify those areas where more people and tools could have been beneficial * This question will help us understand how well the person can handle their tasks, as an overwhelmed employee might not be able to give his best.*
6. Have any of you used a technique or tool (either digital/analog) that has helped manage your workload better? If yes then please share it with others! * This question will help us understand how well the person can handle their tasks, as an overwhelmed employee might not be able to give his best.*
Please let me know if you need any changes or want this in a different format. I am always here for your convenience and comfort :)

Generate me a questionnaire on Workload Management with 5 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of five engaging questions about workload management:
1) How do you prioritize tasks in your daily routine? Is there a specific method or technique that helps manage the volume and importance levels effectively, allowing for more time to be spent on critical items first before moving onto less pressing matters later in the day/week?" 
2) Have you ever felt overwhelmed by workload at any point during this week (or month)? If yes – what steps were taken or could have been implemented earlier so as not feel that way again, and if no - then how do maintain a balance between personal life demands versus professional responsibilities? Please share your secrets!
3) In terms of communication: How often does it happen for you to discuss workload distribution with colleagues/team members before taking on new projects or tasks yourself (or assigning them)? Is there an established protocol within the organization which ensures everyone is aware about their role and how much time they need spend working towards completion?
4) When faced by a large number of responsibilities, do you use any specific software tools to help prioritize your workload better than without it - if so could these be shared with others who may benefit from such technology too?" 5. And finally: Can people effectively manage their own personal and professional lives simultaneously or should there always remain some separation between the two? If yes, then what techniques do you employ to ensure one does not negatively impact another; however, if no – how can someone improve this situation without causing undue stress either mentally physically emotionally etc.
Please let me know whether I need convert these questions into a specific format or add anything else!

Generate me a questionnaire on Workload Management with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of seven engaging questions about workload management:

1) How do you prioritize tasks in your daily routine? Do you have any specific criteria or methods that help guide this process, and if so what are they? Or does it feel more like juggling many different things at once without much strategy behind the scenes? 
2) Have you ever felt overwhelmed by a large workload before? If yes, how did you cope with those feelings of being overloaded – were there any particular techniques or strategies that helped alleviate your stress and make everything feel more manageable again in both short term as well long-term perspective too. 
3) Do others within the company understand what tasks are on YOUR plate? Is it possible for them to know this information so they can better assist you when needed, rather than just assuming certain things aren't their responsibility because "someone else" handles that area or department (perhaps including YOU)?!?! 
4) How do technology and tools play into your workload management strategy? Are there specific applications/software which make managing tasks easier for either an individual OR entire teams, allowing everyone to feel more organized AND productive as a result. If not yet tried such solutions – why NOT??!! And what could be preventing adoption of these seemingly useful innovations?!
5) Do you think about the impact different decisions might have on others when assigning/completing tasks or projects? Or is it simply seen through lens where only personal consequences matter, without considering wider implications beyond just YOU. 
6) How often do people come to ask favors from your side and how well are they prepared for this request (either in terms of time required OR resources needed)? Is there any way we can better manage these requests so as not feel taken advantage or overwhelmed by others’ needs, yet still remain helpful & supportive colleague.
7) Finally – do you have a system to measure your productivity and effectiveness? If yes - how does it work; if no then why hasn't this been implemented already considering its importance in today business world where efficiency is key for success!

-------------------

[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of seven engaging and thought-provoking questions about workplace culture:
1) How would you describe the overall atmosphere at work? Is it collaborative, competitive or something else entirely? What makes you say that?
2) Do managers within your company lead by example when it comes to promoting positive values such as respect for others' opinions and ideas? Can employees see these behaviors in action on a daily basis? 
3) How well do the physical spaces of your workplace reflect its culture, or is there dissonance between what leadership says about their priorities versus how things actually look day-to-day. Please provide specific examples if possible!
4) Is it clear to employees and new hires alike who they can turn for help with a problem? Are mentors easily accessible in your organization's hierarchy, or do people feel like cogs without much support from above them other than their direct supervisor(if at all)? 5. How often are ideas shared across departments within the company - both formally and informally-to encourage cross pollination of thoughts between teams?
6) Does management take into account employee feedback when making decisions, or do they feel like an afterthought in a top down approach to decisionmaking that doesn't allow for much input from those who will be affected by the change most directly. 7. Finally: Can you tell me one word which best describes your workplace culture? And why did YOU choose this particular term over all others available

Questions to ask employees: ------------------

2. Does management lead by example when promoting positive values such as respect for others' opinions and ideas in your company culture ?  Or do they just talk about this but don’t actually demonstrate it through actions, making employees feel unsupported or like an afterthought with little influence over decisions that will affect them directly?
3. How well does the physical space of work reflect its stated values/culture and priorities in your organization's hierarchy ? Can you provide specific examples if possible! 	  
4. Are mentors easily accessible within company’s structure or do people feel like cogs without much support from above them other than their direct supervisor(if at all)? Is it clear to employees who they can turn for help with a problem?   
5. How often are ideas shared across departments in your organization - both formally and informally-to encourage cross pollination of thoughts between teams, making people feel connected even if not physically together most days ? 	  
6. Does management take into account employee feedback when making decisions or do they think that employees don’t have enough knowledge to contribute effectively towards decisionmaking process which makes them disconnected from the whole picture?   
7. Can you tell me one word which best describes your workplace culture and why did YOU choose this particular term over all others available ?

Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Culture with 6 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of six engaging questions about workplace culture:
1) If you were asked to describe our company's culture in three words, what would they be? And why did you choose those specific terms?
2) How do YOU feel when coming into work every day - are there any aspects that could make it better for everyone else too?! :)
3. Can we imagine a situation where someone from another planet visits us and asks about our culture – how can I explain this to them in an interesting way so they understand? (Think big here!) 4) On a scale of 1-5, rate the importance of having fun at work; if your answer is less than five then please share why you think it should be higher!
5. Do we have any unique or special traditions that make our workplace culture stand out from others? If not yet – how can WE create some together?! :) 6) When was last time YOU felt PROUD to say "I work here"? And what made this moment so exceptional for you personally and professionally too!
Please let me know if there is anything else I could help with, or would like these questions in a different format. Have an amazing day ahead-together we can make our workplace culture even better than it already is!! :)

Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Culture with 8 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of eight engaging and thought-provoking questions about workplace culture:
1. How would you describe the overall atmosphere at work? Is it collaborative, competitive or something else entirely? What specific factors contribute to this feeling?
2. Do managers within our organization lead by example in terms of behavior they expect from their team members? Can we say that leadership is consistent with values and principles promoted across all levels? 3. How often do you feel encouraged at work - both through words, actions or policies implemented for employees' well-being ?
4. Is there a sense of community within your organization where everyone feels included regardless if they are physically present in the office space most days per week/month etcetera)? If yes then how strong is this feeling and what steps have been taken to create it? 5. How often do you hear ideas from employees being acknowledged, considered or implemented into daily operations of your company ?
6. Are there any initiatives aimed at making work more enjoyable for all members regardless their position within organizational hierarchy (for example: team-building activities)? If not then why is this important and what could be done to change it? 7. Can you recall a moment when someone's behavior made YOU feel respected, heard or appreciated in your workplace recently ?
8. How does management handle conflicts among employees - do they step back allowing people involved resolve issues themselves using provided tools/resources OR intervene immediately trying solve problems directly with their own judgment calls? 
Please let me know if you would like these questions converted into a specific format!

Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Environment with 6 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of six engaging questions about workplace environment:
1) How would you rate the overall cleanliness and organization of our office space? (5-point scale, from "Extremely Clean" to "Very Dirty")
2) Do you feel that your work station allows for sufficient privacy during phone calls or meetings with colleagues? Please explain.
3) On a 10-point scale: If the temperature in this room was set at level most comfortable for YOU, what number would it be? (e.g., if setting is currently uncomfortable but will become "7", then person prefers temp of ~25 degrees Celsius). Thank you!
4) Have any specific sensory aspects about your work environment been causing discomfort or distraction lately - such as lighting, noise level/type, smell? If yes: Please specify. (e.g., brightness too high; fan always on nearby desk is annoying.) 5) Is there anything you would like to see changed in terms of physical layout and design for our office space that could improve your productivity or happiness at work - such as more plants/greenery, better ergo-friendly chairs?
6. How often do YOU feel the need to leave this building during working hours due solely because it is too hot / cold inside (either through A) window; B )air conditioning system)? Please specify number of times per week or month if applicable and explain reasons for discomfort in detail, thank you!
Please let me know which format I should use to convert this questionnaire.

Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Environment with 5 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of five engaging questions about workplace environment:
1) How would you rate the overall cleanliness and organization of our workspace? (scale from 1-10, where 1 means very poor and 10 extremely good) Can we do better as a team in this area to create an even more pleasant work atmosphere for everyone?
2) Do you feel encouraged by management to share your thoughts about the physical space at work or are there barriers that prevent open communication on these topics, such as fear of retribution if something is not perfect and needs improvement? Please use a scale from 1-5 (where one means "strongly disagree" with this happening in our organization).
3) How often do you see people cleaning up after themselves or others when it comes to shared spaces like the break room, kitchen area etc. Would more frequent reminders about cleanliness help? Please use a scale from 1-5 (where one means "never") for your answer and share any additional comments if desired!
4) How would you rate our organization's commitment towards sustainability in terms of energy consumption habits as well as waste management practices at work, on the same scale used before. Do we need to do more or are satisfied with current efforts? Please elaborate using a few sentences about what could be improved and how if necessary!
5) Finally - have you ever felt that your personal workspace is cluttered by someone else's messiness in our organization (either intentionally/unintentionally)? If yes, please specify who tends to make this happen most often. And do share any thoughts about why certain individuals might struggle with cleanliness and how we could help them improve their habits!
Please let me know if you would like the questions converted into a specified format or have additional comments on these topics before I send over your questionnaire in its final form :)

Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Environment with 7 questions

-------------------

[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of seven engaging questions about workplace environment:
1) If you could describe your current office space in three words, what would they be? Please provide one word for each attribute such as "colorful," "quiet" or "smells like cinnamon."
2) On a scale from 0 to 5 (with five being the highest), how much do YOU think our workplace environment contributes toward your productivity and job satisfaction level at this moment? Please provide reasons for giving that particular score. Thank you! :D
3) How often have you experienced situations where colleagues were not respectful about each other's personal space or things in last three months, on a scale from 0 to 15 (with zero being never and fifteen always)? If yes - what was the most memorable incident? Please share it with us! :P
4) Do YOU think that our current workplace environment encourages creativity among employees at all times of day or night? Why do you say this, in a few words. For example: "Yes" because there are spaces for quiet contemplation and brainstorming sessions OR simply no - not enough windows with natural light! :(
5) On average how many hours per week does your work schedule allow YOU to interact face-to-face (not via email or phone calls!) WITH other team members? Please provide an answer in numbers, for example: "3" if you can only talk personally three times a week. Thanks!! 😊 Include any thoughts about this being good/bad and why it is so!
6) Imagine that YOU are the CEO of our company - what TOP-THREE things would be on your list to improve workplace environment? Please share these with us in detail, including reasons for each one (for example: "better coffee machine" because caffeine boosts productivity and smells great! :D)
7) Finally – do YOU feel that our company's values are reflected well enough through the physical office space we inhabit together? Why is this your opinion about it, in a few words. For instance - YES I believe so much as openness leads to collaboration but NO not at all because there isn’t any quiet place for deep thinking! :(
Please remember that these questions should be answered honestly and without fear of judgment – we want YOUR true feelings here!! Thank you very much, have a nice day. <3
