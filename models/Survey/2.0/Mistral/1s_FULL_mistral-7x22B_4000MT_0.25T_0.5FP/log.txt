[LLM ANSWER]
 **On a scale from one to five, how would you rate your overall satisfaction with this course (1 being very dissatisfied and 5 being completely satisfied)? Please provide specific reasons for the rating.**
 - Very Dissatisfied: I did not like anything about it. The content was irrelevant or outdated; delivery poor in all aspects including structure of sessions, visuals etc.; no opportunity to interact with instructor/peers which made me feel isolated and unsupported throughout course duration leading towards failure!<br>
 - Somewhat Dissatisfied: I felt that the material did not cover my needs fully or was presented poorly. The content could have been more interesting if delivered in a different way, but there were some positives about it.<br>
 - Neutral/Undecided (Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied): It is hard to say whether I am happy with the course as certain aspects of delivery and material are good while others need improvement. The structure might be confusing or not engaging enough, but there were some positives about it.<br>
 - Somewhat Satisfied: Although this was a positive experience overall because content met my needs in many ways (either through interesting activities/exercises; clear explanations etc.), I would have preferred if certain things had been different such as more time with instructor or peers, better visuals. <br>
 - Very satisfied: This course exceeded all expectations! It was well-structured and engaging from start to finish including excellent delivery methods like interactive activities/exercises; clear explanations that helped me learn effectively without any obstacles along the way making it a truly enjoyable experience overall!!<sup><span style="color:#03C5FF">[Ask for additional comments if 4 or higher]</SPAN></sup>

[LLM ANSWER]
 **How often does your company provide feedback to employees (in general)? Please specify:**
- More than once per week, but not daily. This is too much! It can be overwhelming and create an unhealthy expectation that everything will always get done immediately:( - Once a month or less frequently; this might mean the employee doesn't have enough time to reflect on their work before providing feedback which could lead them giving inaccurate information about someone else’s performance.
- Between 2 times per week and once every two weeks, it is just right! This frequency allows for reflection but also keeps things fresh by not letting too much dust gather around the person receiving or delivering this precious gift of constructive criticism:) - More than twice a month; that' s great if you can maintain such high standards without causing burnout.
- I prefer to get feedback in real time, as soon it happens! It helps me learn and adjust my behavior immediately which is perfect for personal growth but might be too intense of an approach when applied at work place where other people are involved:( - Rarely or never; that's not good because then how can one improve their performance if they don’t even know what needs to change?
- I like receiving feedback in a more structured format, such as through surveys and questionnaires. This way it is easier for me process information about my own work style without feeling overwhelmed by too many details at once:) - Other (please specify): ________________. Please note that this answer should be evaluated within the context of your organization's culture to determine whether or not an adjustment needs made in terms providing feedback frequency.
**How do you prefer receiving constructive criticism? Check all options which apply:**
- I like getting it face2face, as soon after something happens because then emotions are still fresh and can be processed more easily:) - Preferably through email or other written format so that there is time to reflect on what has been said before responding. This way one's reaction won’t interfere with the message itself which could lead them missing important details about their performance!
- I like receiving it in a structured form, such as surveys and questionnaires because this makes processing information easier for me:) - Preferably from my direct supervisor or manager so that there is no confusion who should be responsible fixing any issues identified. This way the person delivering criticism can see how their actions affect others directly!
- I like receiving it in a more general format, such as through team meetings where everyone's performance gets discussed together at once:) - Preferably from HR department or other dedicated support staff because they have training and experience necessary to provide constructive feedback without causing burnout. This way the person delivering criticism can see how their actions affect others indirectly!
- I like receiving it in a more anonymous format, such as through an online tool where my identity is protected while still getting specific information about what needs improvement:) - Other (please specify): ________________. Please note that this answer should be evaluated within the context of your organization's culture to determine whether or not an adjustment need made in terms providing constructive criticism.
**Do you think it is important for employees at all levels receive feedback? Why/Why Not:** - Yes, because then everyone knows how they are performing and can make necessary changes without waiting until something goes wrong:)! It helps create a more proactive work environment where people feel empowered to take control of their own growth.
- No, it is not important for employees at all levels receive feedback; some positions might require less supervision than others due the nature tasks performed by those individuals or teams involved in delivering services directly impacting customers:(! This way there could be more time spent on improving other areas which need attention first before focusing too much energy one specific person.
- Yes, but only if it is done through a structured process with clear guidelines and expectations set ahead of time so that everyone knows what they should expect when receiving feedback from others around them:)! This way the risk getting overwhelmed by an unexpected message gets minimized significantly while still allowing for personal growth opportunities within this framework.
- No, because then people might feel like their privacy has been invaded and it could lead to mistrust between colleagues which would negatively impact organizational culture overall :( ! Instead of focusing on individual performance we should focus more broadly at team level where everyone can contribute towards common goals without feeling singled out.
- Other (please specify): ________________. Please note that this answer must be evaluated within the context your organization's values and beliefs about feedback mechanisms in order to determine whether or not an adjustment needs made regarding who receives it at all levels of employment hierarchy inside company walls!

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 **Do you think that the company is taking health & safety measures seriously ? (Strongly agree, Agree...)**
- Strongly disagree
 - Disagree
 - Neither strongly agree nor disagreed
 - Somewhat agreed or somewhat disagreed but closer to not having an opinion. 50/50 split between agreement and disgreement on this question in particular because it is a bit ambiguous, so I am going with the more conservative answer of neither here for now... :( . Strongly agree that there are health & safety measures implemented by company but do they take them seriously?
- Agree or strongly agreed. Yes! They have been working hard to make sure everyone has access and understands how important it is, so I would say yes in this case too :) !!!!!! But still a little bit unsure about the seriousness of these measures... :( . Somewhat agree that company takes health & safety seriously but not strongly.
- Neither agreed nor disagreed - The question here seems to be more focused on whether there are any specific policies or procedures in place, rather than if they're being taken carefully and with consideration for people who might get hurt because of them... :( . I would say that the company has implemented some health & safety measures but it is not clear how much effort goes into making sure these things work properly.
- Somewhat disagree - This answer seems to be a little bit more negative, suggesting there are problems with implementation or communication about what's being done for employees... :( . I would say that the company does have health & safety measures but they might not always consider all aspects and people who will implement them properly.
- Disagree - This answer seems to be even less positive than before, suggesting there is a lack of resources or attention paid towards making sure these things work well... :( . I would say that the company has health & safety measures but they might not always prioritize it as high on their list because something else could take precedence over this.
- Strongly disagree - This answer seems to be very negative, suggesting there are no real efforts being made by management or employees themselves when implementing these policies and procedures... :( . I would say that the company does NOT have health & safety measures in place at all! They might just think about it from time to time without any action taken.
- Agree - This answer seems like a good one, suggesting there are clear signs of commitment towards making sure everyone has access and understands how important these things can be for both physical AND mental wellbeing... :) . I would say that the company does have health & safety measures in place but it is not always easy to see them being implemented properly.
- Strongly agree - This answer seems like a great one, suggesting there are clear signs of commitment towards making sure everyone has access and understands how important these things can be for both physical AND mental wellbeing... :) . I would say that the company does have health & safety measures in place at all times! They might even go beyond what's required by law or regulations because they care so much.
**Do you feel safe while working? (Strongly agree, Agree ...)** - Strongly disagree: Nope :( . I do not think that the company cares about my safety and well-being at all times... It might be more focused on profits than people which is never a good thing! 
   - Disagree. The question here seems to focus less on whether there are any specific policies or procedures in place, but rather if they're being taken care of with consideration for employees who could get hurt because of them... :( . I would say that the company does not make me feel safe while working and it might be more focused on profits than people which is never a good thing!

I would say that the company makes me feel safe while working and it might be more focused on people than profits which is always a good thing!
**Do you think there are enough health & safety measures in place? (Strongly agree, Agree ...)** - Strongly disagree: Nope. The question here seems to focus less about whether these things exist at all or not and rather if they're being taken care of with consideration for people who might get hurt because of them... :( . I would say that the company does NOT have enough health & safety measures in place, but it is more focused on profits than employees which can be a problem sometimes.

[LLM ANSWER]
 **Do you feel safe in your work environment? (Please select only one answer)**
- Yes, I always do. There is no need for additional safety measures to be implemented as the current situation feels secure enough already!
- No, not at all; there are many things that could improve my feeling of security and wellbeing within this space – more attention needs paying towards health &amp; Safety protocols in general... 🤨. Please provide me with a list so I can evaluate it properly (wink)!! **
Do you think your organization has done enough to ensure the safety measures are up-to date?**
 - Yes, they have gone above and beyond! The level of preparedness is commendable 😎 !!
   - Nope; there's still room for improvement. A lot more can be implemented in order make us feel safe at work (eyes open)!! **What steps has your organization taken to prevent accidents?** Please specify: \_\_ .\_ ________.___ ___ __.__ .........
- They have provided ample education and training resources, including regular refreshers on important topics like first aid or fire safety procedures. Plus they've implemented a comprehensive system of checks &amp; balances which helps prevent mishaps from occurring in the workplace! **Do you feel that your organization prioritizes health over productivity?**
 - Yes indeed – it seems as if every decision made takes into account both mental and physical wellbeing first, then considers how this will impact performance secondarily. 🌱 !! ________.___ ___ __.__ !!!_..-._.-_-...---....--.....—……. ........
   - Not really; while there are some good initiatives put forward by management/HR team etc., they don't seem to be making enough effort or prioritizing this essential aspect of employee satisfaction. 😞 !! **Do you believe that your organization cares about the health and safety issues?** (Please select only one answer)
- Yes, I do! They have shown time after time through words AND actions just how much they care for their staff's wellbeing – kudos to them!! 🌻 !! ________.___ ___ __.__ !!!!_..---....--.....—……. ...........
   - Not really; although there might be a few good intentions, I don’t think my organization cares enough beyond lip service or token gestures. They need to do better 🙁 !! **Do you feel that your work environment is free from hazards?** (Please select only one answer)
- Yes! The level of care taken towards making sure everything's safe and secure makes me confident in my surroundings – thank goodness!! ________.___ ___ __.__ !!!!_..---....--.....—……. ........... 
   - Not really; even though there might be some good initiatives, I still feel like more could have been done to make sure all potential hazards are removed from the workplace. We need a higher level of awareness and action here! !! **Do you think that your organization is doing enough for mental health?** (Please select only one answer)
- Yes – they've provided excellent resources, including counseling services or even just an ear to listen when needed most which makes me feel supported in every way possible 🌸 !!! ________.___ ___ __.__ !!---....--.....—……. ..........._.._-._.-
   - Not really; although there might be a few good intentions, I don’t think my organization cares enough about mental health. It needs to become more integrated into our culture and practices! 🙁 !!!

[LLM ANSWER]
 **Do you feel that there are internal mobility opportunities within the company for career progression (promotion, change in role)? Yes No Somewhat Agree Disagree Not Sure How many years have your worked at this current position? Less than one year One to three Three or more Do you think about changing jobs inside of our organization and why yes/no If so what is holding back from making that move within the company (if not already done)?**
  - I am satisfied with my role, no need for change.
    * The process takes too long; there are many steps to be taken before a new position can become vacant or filled by someone else inside of our organization and this is preventing me from making that move at the moment (if not already done).
  - I am waiting on my promotion, but it's taking longer than expected. How do you feel about internal mobility in general? Do you think there are more opportunities for external candidates or within your company as well when a position opens up and why is this so if yes/no If no then what could be the reason preventing people from making that move inside of our organization (if not already done)?**
  - I am satisfied with my current role, but would like to try something new. Do you have any suggestions for how internal mobility opportunities can become more visible and accessible? Yes No Somewhat Agree Disagree Not Sure How do your company's employees feel about the idea of moving internally within our organization or are they resistant towards that concept (if not already done)?**
  - I am satisfied with my current role, but would like to try something new. Do you think there is enough information available for internal mobility opportunities? Yes No Somewhat Agree Disagree Not Sure

[LLM ANSWER]
 **Do you feel comfortable managing your workload and tasks in this organization, without feeling overwhelmed by it all oftentimes? (Please select one answer)**
- Yes: I can manage my responsibilities easily. The amount is just right for me to be able to complete everything on time with good quality too! 😊
- Sometimes but not often – there are moments when the workload feels a bit heavy, yet it's still possible to cope and finish all tasks before deadlines (😐)
- No: I am constantly overloaded. It is difficult for me to manage my responsibilities because of too much on plate! :( ➡️
 - Rarely – only a few times, workload feels unbearable but still can handle it with some extra effort (🤕)
- Never: I am always overloaded and cannot finish everything. It's not healthy or sustainable for me to continue this way! :( ➡️
**How well do you think the organization manages workload distribution among employees? Is there a fair balance of tasks, considering your personal abilities too (Please select one answer)?)**
- Yes: The company does an excellent job at distributing responsibilities fairly and evenly. Everyone has just enough to keep them busy but not overwhelmed! 😊👍
 - Sure – it's mostly fine; however sometimes I feel like others get less workload than me, which makes my day a bit harder (😐)
- Not quite: The organization tries its best yet occasionally misses the mark. It could be better if they paid more attention to individual abilities and needs! ➡️(🤕)
 - No – it's not fair at all, some people get too much work while others have less than half of what I do on daily basis (❎ Not good!) :/
**Do you feel like your personal skills are utilized efficiently in the organization? Is there any waste or mismanagement that could be improved to make better use out from it and yourself as well! Please select one answer.** 😊👍 - Yes: The company uses my abilities perfectly. I am always given tasks where they can shine, making me feel satisfied with work too (😇)
- Not quite – there are moments when skills aren't used optimally but still it is manageable and not a big issue! :) ➡️(🤕) - No: I am constantly underutilized or given tasks which do NOT fit my abilities. It feels like someone else could perform them better than me (Not good!) :/
**Do you feel that your workload is evenly distributed throughout the week? Or are there days when it's too much and others not enough! Please select one answer.** 😊👍 - Yes: The company has managed to distribute my tasks perfectly. I have just right amount of things on plate every day, making me productive all time (😇)
- Not quite – sometimes workload is a bit heavier at beginning or end than other parts! It could be better if they paid more attention here too :( ➡️(𝐈t's not good!) - No: I am constantly overloaded on certain days and then have nothing to do rest of week. This makes me feel stressed out (Not Good)
**Do you think that the organization could benefit from a better workload management system? Please select one answer.** 😊👍- Yes, definitely! The company would be more productive if they had an efficient way for managing tasks and responsibilities among employees like myself too :). - Not quite – there are moments when things slip through cracks but it's not big problem. However with better management system this could improved significantly (🤕)
- No, I don’t think so! The organization is doing just fine without any need for change in workload distribution or task handling at all :).

[LLM ANSWER]
 **Do you feel comfortable discussing workload concerns openly within your team, including management?**
 - Yes, completely
 - Somewhat yes but not always sure how to phrase it properly
- No, never really had the chance or felt safe doing so. Not at all! I need help with this one please :D 
 - Don't know / Prefer not answering (Same for next questions)

 - Yes, completely balanced. I am very satisfied with how it's handled! :D  
- Somewhat yes but there is still room for improvement and better management techniques available out there...

- Somewhat yes but I believe better communication about deadlines could help   
- No way!!! Workload seems to come from everywhere these days :D **Do you feel that your work and nonwork life balance is appropriate?**  
 - Yes, completely! The company provides a good mix of both worlds    
- Somewhat yes but I am struggling with finding time for myself sometimes

(1 being very poor 50% satisfied; scale is from one to ten)**
	- One - Not at all, not even a little bit. I am completely dissatisfied and unhappy about the workplace culture here! To me it's unacceptable that we have such an environment where people don’t feel comfortable or safe enough for them work effectively; this is totally intolerable situation which needs urgent attention from management team in order fix things up quickly before they get worse.
	- Two - I am not satisfied with the workplace culture here at all, but it's better than one point because there are some good points about our organization too that need to be improved as soon possible so we can have a perfect work environment for everyone involved in this process including me; please take necessary steps immediately.
	- Three - I am not completely satisfied with the workplace culture here, but it's better than two and three because there are some good points about our organization too that need to be improved as soon possible so we can have a perfect work environment for everyone involved in this process including me; please take necessary steps immediately.
	- Four - I am neutral when thinking of the workplace culture here, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with it because there are some good points and bad ones too which should get attention from management team to make things better as soon possible so we can have a perfect work environment for everyone involved in this process including me; please take necessary steps immediately.
	- Five - I am completely happy about the workplace culture here, but not more than five because there are some areas that need improvement too which should get attention from management team to make things better as soon possible so we can have a perfect work environment for everyone involved in this process including me; please take necessary steps immediately.

	- Eight - I am completely satisfied with the workplace culture here, and it's more than eight because there are no bad points about our organization at all!

**Do managers/team leaders communicate effectively within your team or department?

	- Two: There are some communication problems between managers/team leaders, but it could definitely improve if we all worked together more often; please help us find ways to communicate better so everyone can understand each other easily without misunderstanding or miscommunication issues arising from time to time in order make things run smoothly.
	- Three: Managers do a good job communicating with their teams, but there is still room for improvement which should get attention immediately because communication plays an important role when it comes down making sure everyone understands what they need to accomplish and how all those pieces fit together as whole picture; please help us find ways.
