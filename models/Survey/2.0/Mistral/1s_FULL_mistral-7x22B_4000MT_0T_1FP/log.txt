[LLM ANSWER]
 **What is your favorite feedback mechanism for teams and why it's effective in improving team performance.** (Multiple Choice) * Face-to face meeting.

  - Other: Please specify in comments section below what other feedback mechanism you prefer.

[LLM ANSWER]
 **What is your current role within this company, either as an employee or manager in the HR department responsible for diversity training programs?** &ast; Employee / Manager (HR) *&gt;&nbsp;"Diverse" workforce composition has become a buzzword and I am curious to know if it's just that - words without action.

[LLM ANSWER]
 **How often do your team members work remotly or from different location than office building in one week (percentage)?**. This is an open-ended, numerical response type of answer. The possible answers are: Monday - less then half day; Tuesday – full time remote working but not all the way through to Friday and so on
 	* I would say that my team members work remotely or from different location than office building in one week (percentage) is as follows [insert percentage] % of total. Please note, this question should be asked at beginning before any other questions about smart working are introduced because it will give a better understanding if people have the same level and frequency to do remote work
 	* I would say that my team members use Smart Working methods for more than half time in one week (percentage) is as follows [insert percentage] % of total. Please note, this question should be asked at beginning before any other questions about smart working are introduced because it will give a better understanding if people have the same level and frequency to do remote work
