Acknowledgement: I'd like to express my gratitude to you, as it is often enjoyable to converse with you. I appreciate the time and effort you put into creating these prompts, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this conversation unfolds.

Question: I'm working on a project to create a recognition and rewards program for a company. I want to know if people believe that recognition and rewards should be given based on performance, attendance, tenure, position, and education level. Can you help me convert the question into a multiple choice format with a follow-up question for each choice?

Answer: Sure, I can help you convert the question into a multiple choice format with a follow-up question for each choice.

**Do you believe that recognition and rewards should be given based on performance?**

*If you selected yes, do you believe that recognition and rewards should be given based on a specific performance metric?*

*If you selected no, what do you believe is the most important factor when determining recognition and rewards?*

**Do you believe that recognition and rewards should be given based on attendance?**

*If you selected yes, do you believe that attendance should be tracked and rewarded for both in-person and remote workers?*

*If you selected no, what do you believe is the most important factor when determining recognition and rewards?*

**Do you believe that recognition and rewards should be given based on tenure within the company?**

*If you selected yes, do you believe that recognition and rewards should be given for both full-time and part-time employees?*

*If you selected no, what do you believe is the most important factor when determining recognition and rewards?*

**Do you believe that recognition and rewards should be given based on an employee's position within the company?**

*If you selected yes, do you believe that recognition and rewards should be given based on an employee's title?*

*If you selected no, what do you believe is the most important factor when determining recognition and rewards?*

**Do you believe that recognition and rewards should be given based on an employee's education level?**

*If you selected yes, do you believe that recognition and rewards should be given based on an employee's specific degree?*

*If you selected no, what do you believe is the most important factor when determining recognition and rewards?*

In this multiple choice format, each question is asking whether recognition and rewards should be based on a specific factor, and if that factor is selected, it dives deeper into that factor. If the answer is no, it asks what the most important factor is when determining recognition and rewards. This allows us to understand the specific factors that people believe are important when determining recognition and rewards.
