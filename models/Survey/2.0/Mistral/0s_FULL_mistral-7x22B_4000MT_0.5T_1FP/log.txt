	to continue: The work schedule is healthy because it allows time for rest and relaxation as well has enough hours to complete tasks. However there are some unhealthy aspects such management not being present, lack of team building activities or even communication between staff members which could be improved with more interaction within the workplace; but overall think that our current system works quite nicely!
Please select one option:<br>a) Strongly disagree <b)> Somewhat agree (1/2 way point): biconditional agreement.<c>) Agree. d)"Strongily agreed" e). Other, and specify:`  	selectedOption=Agreed`

[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! I can help you generate a variety of engaging feedback mechanism-related survey Questions in English: "If words could be transformed into beautiful music, then communication would truly become the most important language to learn." Here are seven dynamic and interactive statements for your questionnaire. Feel free adjust them as needed based on specific requirements or audience preferences!
1) On a scale of 0 (not at all likely/likely), please rate how often you provide feedback about work-related tasks: "How would YOU assess the probability that constructive criticism will help us reach greater heights together?" I find this question captivating because it allows me to understand if people are open and willing participants in providing critical yet helpful comments.
2) Which communication channel do they prefer when giving or receiving feedback? Let's see how many times we can say, "The power of speech is a potent one" before revealing the answer choices: Email (36%), In-person conversation with eye contact and body language cues 41%, Phone call for private conversations without interruptions -20%.
Please select your preference. Thank you! <|< If I were able, then hearing someone's voice while sharing thoughts about their work would be my top choice too; it just feels so much more personal than other methods sometimes... But hey whatever makes people comfortable should always come first right? :) 3) In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our current feedback system let me ask: "Can you please share an instance when someone's words encouraged YOU and made a positive impact on your motivation?"
4. To gauge how important it is for individuals receiving constructive criticism, answer this question -"How much do people value being told they did something wrong even if given in kindest possible way? Or would rather not know about any mistakes because can learn from them without direct confrontation." Please choose one option: Yes (42%), No(58%)
 	6. Let's check whether our team is ready for a two-way street when it comes to feedback by asking - "Are you open and receptive enough so that others can tell YOU things too, or do we need more work on being able listen without getting defensive?" Please answer honestly: Yes (53%) No(47%).
 	6. We all have different opinions about how often should be giving/receiving feedback but let me ask - "If given a chance to decide frequency of sharing thoughts, would choose every day as best option or prefer something less frequent?" Please select one choice: Every Day (39%) Less Frequent Option(61%).
 	7. Finally time for some fun and interactive question! Imagine you are receiving feedback in form other than words - "What type of animal/object would YOU like to see standing before You delivering constructive criticism, or what about hearing it from?" Please choose an option: A gentle kitten (25%), a majestic lion(30%) ,a soothing ocean waves soundtrack playing at low volume in background- 17%,or friendly robot who speaks politely and never gets angry -  48%.
Thank you! I hope this questionnaire helps uncover some insights into feedback mechanisms within your company.

Generate me a questionnaire on Health and Safety Measures with 5 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! I can generate five engaging health and safety measures-relatedquestions for you:
1) How would YOU rate our company's current efforts in promoting employee wellness through ergonomic furniture? (Please select from the following options - Terrible, Poor , Average / Good or Very good ) 🛋️🌍💪🏽‍♂️♻️. The question includes a few different elements to make it more engaging for your employees and can help you gather valuable insights about their perceptions of wellness in our company culture!
2) In the past month, have YOU actively participated or initiated any health & safety discussions with colleagues? (Yes / No). This one is great because we're all human beings trying to make a difference together 🤝✍️‍♂ACE. It also makes you reflect on your personal behavior and how it affects the people around!
3) Have YOU ever felt unsafe in our office space due lack of proper ventilation or temperature control? (Yes / No). This one is simple but effective because everyone has their own comfort zone, which can be affected by factors like air quality 🌫️‍♨. It's also a great way to raise awareness about how important it might feel for people!
4) How often do YOU think we should have health and safety training sessions? (Once per quarter / Twice or more). This question is excellent because you want your employees engaged, informed & empowered 🤩‍🔥. It also makes them consider the importance of being prepared in case something happens!
5) Can You name at least two different types Of hazards that could be present In our workplace? (Yes / No). This one is great because it's an opportunity to learn and teach others about potential dangers 📚‍➡️. It also makes people think beyond their usual routine!
Please let me know if you want any changes in the format of these questions or need more information on how they can be used for your specific scenario, I'll make sure to help out with that too ;)

-------------------

[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! I can generate a variety of engagingquestionnaires for you in just moments, no matter how busy or stressed out my human colleagues are feeling at any given moment:DHere is your leadership effectiveness survey formatted as an attractive and easy-to use online questionnaire. The sevenquestions have been designed to be both informativeand enjoyable so that participants will feel inspired rather than intimidated by the process!
1) Do you consider yourself a good leader? Please explain why orwhy not in one short sentence (if possible!)2.) Have your employees ever come up with an ideaor solution for something at work, and if yes - didyou implement it even though they mightnot be considered "qualified" team members accordingto some standards of leadership effectiveness(e.g., age/experience level)?3) How often do you ask yourself what kindof leader YOU want to become? And how does this questionmake a difference in your daily life at work or home (if itdoes!).4.) Are there any particular challenges thatyou feel only qualified leaders can solve, and if so -what are they specifically about(e.g., technical skills)?5) When was the last time you receivedconstructive criticism from someone who worksunderneath YOU on how to lead better? How did thisfeedback change your perspective or actions movingforward as a leader (if at all!).6.) Do others feel heard byyou during conversations and meetings, especiallywhen discussing issues related directly toworkplace performance/efficiency etc. - if not- whatsteps could be taken immediatelyto improve listening skills(either personallyor through organizational changes)?
7) Finally... do you believe that a good leader isdefined moreby their personal qualities than bytheir professional ones? If yes, which specificpersonal traits make someone "good" in yourmind (please provide at least 3 examples).Remember - there are no right or wrong answers here!These questions should help us all think deeper aboutwhat it means to be an effective leader and howwe can improve our own leadership abilities.
Please let me know if you would like this converted into a specific format, such as Microsoft Word document with the same information included in each question but presented differently for maximum accessibility or even printed out on paper!

 Sure! I'm happy to help you generate a survey about "OnBoarding ExPerience" or ONBEX for short, in an engaging way:
1) When asked how they felt during the first week of work at our company. what would be their answer? (Multiple choice with 4 options - Very excited and engaged / Somewhat indifferent/ Didn't care about it much // Felt a bit overwhelmed ) [2] Ona scale from one to ten, please rate your agreement that we have provided you all the necessary resources for work.
3) How would they describe our company culture in 5 words or less? (Quick text input field allowed here). If needed can give them an example: "Collaborative and inclusive" is a good summary of it! :) [4] Did your manager reach out to you during the first week onboarding process with us, if yes what was their message then ?
5) Are they satisfied overall in terms that our company values aligns or not aligned? (Multiple choice again here - Yes / No ) If no can give them a chance for open text input field. "Why do you think so?" question would be great! [6] In the end, how likely are we to recommend us as an employer if given 10 points scale on first glance ?
Please let me know what format is needed and I will convert it accordingly !

Generate me a questionnaire on Recognition and Rewards with 8 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of eight engagingquestions about recognition and rewards:
1) How important do you think it is for an organization's success that employees feel recognized? Please rate this from "not at all" to 'extremely." Also, please indicate how often people in your company get praised or rewarded. Is there a direct correlation between the number of times recognition takes place and employee satisfaction?"
2) Have you ever received an award for something specific that made its recipient feel like their efforts were valued? If yes: what was it about this experience which stood out from others, making them special in your eyes (and heart)? How can we replicate such moments more often within our company culture and practices; if not - why do you think recognition is missing at work place?"
3) Can people be motivated just by monetary rewards or does intrinsic motivation play a bigger role too? If yes, then how would one measure the value of this internal drive to an organization. And what are some ways we can foster it in our employees and teams so they feel appreciated for their hard work without necessarily giving tangible gifts each time?"
4) Are there any specific types or methods used when recognizing people's contributions that you think make a difference between successes, failures? If yes: which ones do resonate most with your team members; if not - why can we say recognition is failing at times despite best efforts from management and other stakeholders?"
5) How often should an employee get praised for their work before feeling undervalued or unnoticed in the organization, assuming everything else remains constant? Does this vary depending on position level within a company (e.g., manager vs individual contributor)? And if yes: what's your opinion about ideal frequency of recognition and rewards?"
6) How can we make sure that everyone has equal opportunities to be recognized for their hard work irrespective whether they are introverted or extrovert? Are there any practices in place at our company which might hinder some people from getting noticed while others get praised frequently, even if both groups deserve same level of appreciation?"
7) What would you consider as "enough" recognition and reward for doing a good job - something that will make employees feel appreciated but not overly pampered? Is there such thing like too much praise or does it always bring positive results regardless how often we give compliments to others, including ourselves in professional environment?"
8) Do you think people are more likely recognize the effort put into a task rather than outcome itself when evaluating performance and assigning awards/prizes? If yes: what makes this happen. And if not - why can't both elements be recognized simultaneously without favoritism or bias towards one over other?"

Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Culture with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of seven engagingquestions about workplace culture:
1) If you were asked for one word that describes our company's current work environment, what would it be? Please share an example if necessary. For instance - "collaborative" could mean we have open communication and teamwork between departments but might also include a suggestion to improve collaboration by using more collaborate tools or encouraging people from different teams/departments interact regularly through events outside of work hours (either in-person activities such as lunch outings, sports games).
2) How would you rate your level on the scale 1 -5 about how well our company's values align with yours? Please also provide suggestions if any value mismatch exists. For example: "I feel that there is a gap between my personal beliefs and those of this organization concerning work-life balance; perhaps we could make changes in shift schedules or offer more flexible hours."
3) On the scale 1 -5, how would you rate your overall satisfaction with our company's workplace culture? If less than five please share what steps can be taken to increase it. For instance: "I believe that a better communication strategy could help us understand each other and feel part of one team; we should have regular meetings where everyone gets equal time speaking."
4) Do you think there are enough opportunities for growth within the company? If not, how would this change affect your motivation at work. For instance: "I don't believe that I am getting all necessary chances to become better and learn new skills; perhaps we could introduce more professional development programs or mentoring system."
5) How often do you get feedback about performance in the company? Do people talk openly, honestly with their colleagues regarding areas where improvement can be made. If not then how would this change positively impact your work experience if at all possible within our organization culture policy frameworks and rules set by management team members who have power over these decisions."
6) How do you feel about the level of diversity in terms both ethnicity/race, gender identity & expression as well age range present inside company premises? If not diverse enough then what steps should be taken to increase it. For instance: "I think that we could benefit from having a more varied workforce regarding all aspects including race and culture; perhaps by implementing recruitment strategies targeting underrepresented groups or offering training programs focused on issues related directly those communities."
7) Can you share any thoughts about the level of inclusivity in your company? If not, how would this change positively impact both employees' motivation levels & satisfaction scores. For instance: "I don’t feel completely included here because I am part from another country and sometimes have trouble understanding certain cultural references or nuances used by majority team members; perhaps we could introduce some sort of inclusivity training program."

Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Environment with 6 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of six engagingquestions about workplace environment:
1a) On average, how many days per week do you feel that there are too few quiet and peaceful moments at work? (0-7 scale). If the answer tends toward zero it means things can be TOO noisy. 25% Quietude Score! How did I get a score of:
[Quite/Very often] [Not quite enough, but close to perfect]. My preference is for quieter workspaces and people are generally happier in them - even if they need some alone time too :). It's important because it affects productivity. 1b) On average how many hours per day do you feel like there could be more focus on your tasks? (0-8 scale, where zero means no breaks at all and eight that person is constantly in deep sleep.)
2a} How often have YOU personally felt the need for a change of scenery or place to work during past 3 months – with emphasis given as: [Never / Rarely/ Sometimes but not too much!] I feel like changing things up sometimes. It keeps me fresh and motivated, so if you can provide opportunity then please do :).
2b} How often has YOUR COMPANY provided a change of scenery or place to work during past 3 months – with emphasis given as: [Never / Rarely/ Sometimes but not too much!] I am glad that my company is providing opportunities for people who need them. It's important because it affects productivity and happiness at workplace, so if you can give this opportunity then please do :).
2c} How often would YOU like to have a change of scenery or place while working in the next 3 months – with emphasis given as: [Never / Rarely/ Sometimes but not too much!] I am always happy where there are plants and fresh air. It's important because it affects productivity, so if you can provide opportunity then please do :).
2d} How often would YOU like your COMPANY to offer a change of scenery or place while working in the next 3 months – with emphasis given as: [Never / Rarely/ Sometimes but not too much!] I am always happy where there are plants and fresh air. It's important because it affects productivity, so if you can provide opportunity then please do :).
5a) Think about your last place of work (if more than one): How many times did YOU PERSONALLY feel like THAT WAS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE? Please answer as: [0-1 / 2/ More]. I am a sensitive person and sometimes places just don't agree with me. But it can be hard to tell if the problem is ME or THEM, so please let others know about this too :).
5b) Think of your last place but now think wider: How many times did YOU PERSONALLY feel like THAT WAS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE for a whole team? Please answer as [0-1 / 2/ More]. I am very sensitive to others' needs and sometimes places just don’t agree with me. But it can be hard
to tell if the problem is ME or THEM, so please let everyone know about this too :).

Generate me a questionnaire on Workplace Environment with 5 questions

-------------------

[LLM ANSWER]
 Sure! Here is a set of five engagingquestions about workplace environment:
1) How would you rate our company's current physical workspace? Is it conducive for productivity and collaboration, or does the layout need improvement to encourage better communication between team members (Circle-Yes / No)? 	extends from Circle Yes/No question type. If yes then "That is great!", if no ask why
2) How often do you feel comfortable giving negative feedback in our current workplace? Please rate it on a scale of one to ten, where five means only sometimes and nine or higher indicates that the person finds very hard (Scale-1/5=Sometimes; 6..9 = Hard for me ; Circle - Yes / No)
3. Do you feel like your personal work style is supported in this workplace? For example: If someone prefers working late at night, are they able to do that or not! Please rate it on a scale of one (not supportive )to five(totally supports). 	extends from Scale-1/5=Not Supportive /2 = Neutral;3..4 Not Much , Circle - Yes if greater than four
   and No otherwise. If yes, then that is great! Otherwise ask why not? (Circle) or Nahi Hota toh bta diaa :P 	extends from Scale-1/5=Not Supportive /2 = Neutral;3..4 Not Much , Circle - Yes if greater than four and No otherwise. If yes, then that is great! Otherwise ask why not?
