This is a JSON representation of the Internal Mobility Opportunities Questionnaire. It includes six questions, five of which are multiple choice and one is a rating question. The first question asks whether the respondent has ever been offered an internal mobility opportunity within the company, and the second question asks how many times they have been offered such an opportunity. The third and fourth questions ask whether internal mobility opportunities are adequately communicated and accessible to all employees, and the fifth question asks which internal mobility opportunities the respondent would be interested in. The sixth question is a rating question asking about the respondent's opinion of internal mobility opportunities.
