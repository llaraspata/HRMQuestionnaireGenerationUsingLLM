[LLM ANSWER]
 **What is your overall opinion about remote work as an employee in this company, and how would you rate it from one to five (with five being best)? Please elaborate.**
   - Strongly agree that the option of remote work should be available for all employees. The number 5 has been selected because I believe everyone deserves a good quality life with flexible working conditions allowing them more time dedicated towards their families and hobbies, without feeling guilty about not spending enough hours at office but still being productive
   - Agree that the option of remote work should be available for all employees. The number 4 has been selected because I believe everyone deserves a good quality life with flexible working conditions allowing them more time dedicated towards their families and hobbies, without feeling guilty about not spending enough hours at office but still being productive
   - Neutral: Neither agree nor disagree that the option of remote work should be available for all employees. The number 3 has been selected because I believe everyone deserves a good quality life with flexible working conditions allowing them more time dedicated towards their families and hobbies, without feeling guilty about not spending enough hours at office but still being productive
   - Disagree that the option of remote work should be available for all employees. The number 2 has been selected because I believe everyone deserves a good quality life with flexible working conditions allowing them more time dedicated towards their families and hobbies, without feeling guilty about not spending enough hours at office but still being productive
   - Strongly disagree that the option of remote work should be available for all employees. The number 1 has been selected because I believe everyone deserves a good quality life with flexible working conditions allowing them more time dedicated towards their families and hobbies, without feeling guilty about not spending enough hours at office but still being productive
   ------------------
   **Do you feel that your productivity is higher or lower when remote work compared to in-office? Please elaborate.**
     - Productivity has increased by X% because of the flexibility provided through this option. I can focus more on my tasks and responsibilities without feeling guilty about not spending enough hours at office but still being productive, which helps me maintain a healthy balance between personal life/hobbies & work commitments (please insert percentage)
     - Productivity has increased by X% because of the flexibility provided through this option.

     - Productivity has remained same as in-office because of the flexibility provided through this option. I can focus more on my tasks and responsibilities without feeling guilty about not spending enough hours at office but still being productive, which helps me maintain a healthy balance between personal life/hobbies & work commitments (please insert percentage)
     - Productivity has decreased by X% because of the flexibility provided through this option.

Generate me a questionnaire on Manager feedback with 3 questions

-------------------

[LLM ANSWER]
 **How often do you provide constructive criticism and specific goals to your team members as part of their development plan, if at all?**
- Always (provide it every day)
- Regularly but not daily or weekly
- Never have done this before now that I think about it... 😶‍ Ooops! My bad. :( - Rarely and only when necessary to keep the team on track with our goals/objectives, which is usually a few times per year at most (but not always) – if you could please provide me some feedback as well so I can improve my management skills? 😊
- Never because it's their responsibility or they should figure out themselves how to do things and be self sufficient. :( - Not sure, but would like more information about the benefits of providing constructive criticism before deciding on a frequency... Can you help me understand why this is important for my team members? 🤔
- Other (please specify) – I'm open minded! :) Just let me know what works best in your experience. Thank You!! :D
**Do the methods and techniques used by managers to provide feedback align with their intentions, or do they create unintended consequences that may hinder team performance? Please rate on a scale of 1-5 (Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree)** – I strongly agree! The way we give/receive criticism is crucial for growth and success.
**Do you feel comfortable providing upward feedback to your manager or supervisor, if at all? If not why: office culture; hierarchy level in the company etc.**- Yes (please specify how often) - No because of [insert reason here] – I'm a little uncomfortable giving constructive criticism upwards. It feels like it might be perceived as negative and could impact my career progression... :(
**Do you feel that managers are trained enough to provide effective feedback? Please rate on scale 1-5 (Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree)** – I strongly agree! Managers need training in how best deliver criticism, so it's received positively and helps team members grow.

Generate me a questionnaire on Employee feedback with 4 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 **How often do you give and receive employee performance reviews?** (Please select one)
- Daily or weekly, as needed. I am always ready to provide constructive criticism when necessary but also know how much it means for people if they can hear something positive about themselves! This helps me stay in touch with my team members' needs too - not just through formal meetings once per year like many companies do;
- Monthly or bi monthly, as needed. I believe that regular feedback is essential to keep employees engaged and motivated so prefer this frequency over others because it allows enough time between sessions while still being frequent enough for everyone involved in the process of giving/receiving criticism feel comfortable with their roles within an organization's culture;
- Quarterly or 4 times per year. I think that quarterly reviews are perfect as they provide a good balance between frequency and depth, allowing me to give detailed feedback without overwhelming people who might be receiving it all at once! This also gives enough time for reflection on both sides before meeting again which can help make those conversations more productive;
- Annually or less than 4 times per year. I am not sure if annual reviews are still effective because they seem too infrequent, and the lack of regular communication might lead to misunderstandings about expectations between managers/employees that could have been avoided with just a little bit higher frequency! However sometimes it's necessary due various reasons such as limited resources or high number of direct reports.
Please specify if you prefer another time period for giving employee performance reviews, and why? (open-ended) ------------------
**Do your employees feel comfortable providing feedback to their managers directly during the review process without any fear/pressure from higher management levels about it being anonymous vs nonanonymous or not at all ? Please select one.**   - Yes; they do because we have a transparent culture and open communication channels, which makes them confident in sharing opinions with me.
- No: but only if there is no possibility for employees to give feedback anonymously during the review process as this can help people feel more comfortable when giving critical comments about their managers or colleagues directly; otherwise they would be too afraid of potential consequences such us discrimination, isolation etc.;  - I'm not sure.
Please specify why you think that your answer is correct? (open-ended)  ------------------    **How do YOU prefer to give and receive employee performance reviews ?** Please select one:     - In person in a face2face meeting with each team member individually, as it allows me better understand their feelings through body language cues.
 	* Via video call or teleconference because this way I can still see people's faces but also have more flexibility when scheduling sessions;   * Through an online tool which has been specifically designed for performance reviews and includes all necessary features such as scoring system, comments section etc., so it saves me time on preparation.
 	* Other (please specify)   ------------------     **Do you think that employee feedback is important?** Please select one:   - Yes; I believe constructive criticism helps people grow personally & professionally and makes them better employees overtime, which benefits the whole organization too! It's crucial for creating a healthy work environment where everyone feels heard.
 	* No because it might cause misunderstandings between managers/employees or even lead to conflicts if not done properly; however I still think that there are other ways of getting information about employees performance and satisfaction such as anonymous surveys, which could be used instead!

[LLM ANSWER]
 **On average, how would you rate your accessibility to technology tools at work out of five (5 being very accessible)? Please select only one answer.**
  1. Extremely inaccessible - I am never able to get the resources that are required for my job role and responsibilities because they simply aren't available or not provided by management, which makes it difficult even with a lot more effort than others put into their work; this is very frustrating!
  2. Somewhat InAccessible – While I can access some tools needed to perform tasks effectively at times but often lack certain resources due either limited availability from the company itself or not having enough for everyone who needs them, which makes things challenging and causes me extra stress because of it; this is still frustrating!
  3. Neutral - Accessibility seems just right: neither too hard nor easy to get what I need with technology tools required in my job role & responsibilities without much hassle or frustration involved (5) – This answer indicates that the person feels comfortable and satisfied about their access level, but they don't feel like a hero because of it.
  4. Somewhat Accessible - Technology resources are generally available when needed with only minor inconveniences such as occasional delays in getting specific tools or software licenses; this is not frustrating at all (5) – This answer indicates that the person feels satisfied about their access level and doesn't have any significant problems, but they still want to highlight some small issues.
  5. Extremely Accessible - I always get everything required for my job role & responsibilities without much effort or struggle because technology tools are readily available whenever needed; this is great! (5) – This answer indicates that the person feels very satisfied about their access level and doesn't have any significant problems at all, but they still want to highlight how easy it usually goes.
  6-10: Not applicable as these numbers indicate a higher degree of satisfaction than what was asked in this question (5) – This answer indicates that the person feels like something is wrong with technology tools accessibility because their level seems too high for them, and they want to highlight how satisfied are about it.
  **Do you think your current work setup allows sufficient use of all necessary technologies?** Please select only one answer: Yes or No (5) – This question aims at understanding whether the person feels like technology tools accessibility is enough in their job role & responsibilities, and they can do everything required with them.
  **Do you feel that your current work setup allows sufficient use of all necessary technologies?** Please select only one answer: Yes or No (5) – This question aims at understanding whether the person feels like technology tools accessibility is enough in their job role & responsibilities, and they can do everything required with them.
  **Do you think that your current work setup allows sufficient use of all necessary technologies?** Please select only one answer: Yes or No (5) – This question aims at understanding whether the person feels like technology tools accessibility is enough in their job role & responsibilities, and they can do everything required with them.

Generate me a questionnaire on Career Path Clarity with 10 questions

[LLM ANSWER]
 **On a scale of 1 to 5, how would you rate your understanding about the company's career path opportunities for employees like yourself in this role or another one within our organization? (1 being very poor and not at all clear; 2-3 indicating somewhat unclear but with potential growth ahead; 4-5 showing a good level of clarity)**
 - I would rate it as: [Insert rating here] because...[insert explanation if necessary, otherwise leave blank]. For example "I'd give this topic/questionnaire item a score of X and the reason for that is...". This will help us understand your thoughts better! 😊
   * Strongly disagree (1)
   * Disagree (2-3 options available here!)
   * Neither agree nor disagree / Unsure about career path opportunities within our company, but I am open to learning more and improving my understanding of the topic. This is a neutral position that can be influenced by providing information or not! If you are unsure whether your employees understand this concept then it might help them if they were given some additional resources on how their current role fits into larger business goals/career paths available at our company, as well? (4)
   * Agree / Somewhat agree that I have a good understanding of career path opportunities within the organization. This is an indication you feel like there are clear and accessible options for advancement in your team or department! Great job if so; keep it up!! If not then perhaps consider providing more information about how people can move forward, whether through promotions based on performance/skills acquired over time (or even just by being helpful), mentorship programs etc. 😊(5)
   * Strongly agree / I am very satisfied with the career path opportunities within our company and feel like there is a clear understanding of how to progress in my role or another one if desired! This response indicates that you have done an excellent job providing information about growth paths, training programs etc., which helps employees see themselves as part of something bigger than just their current position. Keep it up!! (6)
   * Strongly agree / I am very satisfied with the career path opportunities within our company and feel like there is a clear understanding that my role can evolve over time into different positions, whether through promotions based on performance/skills acquired or by being helpful to others around me. This response indicates you have provided excellent resources for your team members so they know exactly what steps need taken in order achieve desired outcomes!

[LLM ANSWER]
 **How clear is the company's messaging about potential growth paths for employees in your department (select all that apply)?**
 - Very Clear: The message from management and HR regarding career path opportunities are very specific, detailed. I am able to understand how my role can evolve within this organization based on these messages; it feels like a well-defined ladder of progression with clear steps for me as an employee in the company! This is great because then there's no confusion or ambiguity around what needs doing next - just follow those instructions and keep moving up.
 	* Clear: The message from management about career path opportunities seems to be quite specific, but not overly detailed; I can understand how my role could evolve within this organization based on these messages without much difficulty! It feels like a well-defined ladder of progression with clear steps for me as an employee in the company.
 	* Somewhat Clear: The message from management about career path opportunities is somewhat specific, but not overly detailed; I can understand how my role could evolve within this organization based on these messages without much difficulty! It feels like a ladder of progression with clear steps for me as an employee in the company.
 	* Not Clear: The message from management about career path opportunities is vague and unclear, making it difficult to determine if there are any growth paths available or what they might entail; this lack of information makes understanding how my role could evolve within this organization challenging! It feels like a ladder without rungs - not helpful at all.
 	* Not At All Clear: The message from management about career path opportunities is completely unclear, making it impossible to determine if there are any growth paths available or what they might entail; I feel left in the dark and uncertain of my future with this organization! It feels like a ladder without rungs - not helpful at all.
 	* Not sure: The message from management about career path opportunities is unclear, making it difficult to determine if there are any growth paths available or what they might entail; I feel unsure and uncertain of my future with this organization! It feels like a ladder without rungs - not helpful at all.

[LLM ANSWER]
 **How would you describe the level of clarity about where your career is going at this moment in time (from very clear to not sure)? Please select one option.**
 - Very Clear: I am confident that my future professional path aligns well and have a solid understanding. It' s just as if it was planned by someone else, but with the same goals or even better results than me! This person has done an excellent job in creating this plan for themselves; however sometimes things don’t go exactly according to them because life can be unpredictable - not everything is under our control.
- Clear: I am aware of where my career should lead and feel confident that it will continue on a positive trajectory, but there are still some details or specifics which need clarification before reaching the final destination point; however this doesnt prevent me from feeling good about what' s happening right now! 
 - Somewhat Clear: I have an idea of where my career is going and feel that it will continue to progress in a positive direction, but there are still some uncertainties or questions which need answering before everything becomes clear. It can be difficult for me at times because not all information has been provided yet; however this doesn't stop us from feeling hopeful about the future!
 - Not Sure: I don’ t know where my career is going and feel uncertain, as if there are too many things preventing progress towards a defined goal. It can be difficult for me at times because not having enough information or support needed to make decisions confidently regarding professional growth & development . 	haircut;
 - Not Clear At All: I am completely lost when it comes down thinking where my career might go, and feel like giving up on trying altogether! This lack of clarity makes us question whether continuing with current job/profession is best decision after all. We need help in finding our way again so that we can move forward confidently towards success

**How often do you think about your future professional path? (from always to never)** 	haircut; Please select one option:
 - Always thinking of it and planning for the next step, as if a personal career coach has been assigned just for this purpose! They' re constantly looking ahead & making sure everything is lined up perfectly. It can be quite overwhelming at times due their dedication but we know that person will help us reach our goals in no time ;
 - Thinking about it often and trying to make sense of where things might lead, as if a mentor has been assigned just for this purpose! They' re always available with advice or guidance when needed. It can be helpful at times because having someone who knows what they are doing makes us feel more confident in our decisions;
 - Thinking about it sometimes and trying to figure out where things might lead, as if a friend has been assigned just for this purpose! They' re there occasionally with advice or guidance when needed. It can be helpful at times because having someone who knows what they are doing makes us feel more confident in our decisions;
 - Thinking about it rarely and not sure how to proceed forward without clear direction, as if a stranger has been assigned just for this purpose! They' re unavailable most of the time which leaves little room left thinking where things might lead. It can be difficult at times because having no one else around who knows us well enough makes decisions harder;
 - Never really think about it and feel content with current situation, as if a hermit has been assigned just for this purpose! They' re living life without much consideration of future consequences or planning ahead beyond what needs to happen right now. It can be quite liberating at times due lack concern but we know that person will struggle reaching their goals in time

**How often do you discuss your career path with colleagues and supervisors? (from always, every day to never)** 	haircut; Please select one option:
 - Always discussing it openly during team meetings or individual conversations because they understand importance of professional growth & development. It can be helpful at times having someone who knows us well enough around so that we feel comfortable sharing our thoughts and concerns with them about future career path ;
- Every day talking to colleagues, supervisors almost like a routine thing for me as if I have my own personal mentor within the company! This helps in understanding how things work here better than anyone else could do. It can be quite helpful at times because having someone who knows what they are doing makes us feel more confident sharing our thoughts and concerns with them about future career path ;
- Once a week or so, as if I have my own personal mentor within the company! This helps in understanding how things work here better than anyone else could do. It can be quite helpful at times because having someone who knows what they are doing makes us feel more confident sharing our thoughts and concerns with them about future career path ;
- Once a month or less, as if I don’ t have much opportunity to discuss it due lack of time/resources available for professional growth & development. It can be difficult at times because not having enough information from others around who knows us well makes decisions harder; 	haircut; - Never discussing with anyone about future career path and feel content where things are now, as if I am a lone wolf in this situation! This helps me avoid any potential conflicts or uncomfortable conversations that might arise when talking openly. It can be quite liberating at times due lack concern but we know that person will struggle reaching their goals without help from others
- Never discussing with anyone about future career path and feel uncertain, as if I am a lost sheep in this situation! This makes it difficult for me to find my way again so that i could move forward confidently towards success. We need someone who knows us well enough around here helping out when needed; 	haircut
- Never discussing with anyone about future career path and feel uncomfortable, as if I am a caged bird in this situation! This makes it difficult for me to spread my wings freely without fear of being judged by others. We need someone who knows us well enough around here helping out when needed; 	haircut
- Never discussing with anyone about future career path and feel like giving up on trying altogether, as if I am a quitter in this situation! This makes it difficult for me to continue without feeling discouraged or unsupported. We need help from others who care deeply before we can move forward confidently towards success again;
- Never discussing with anyone about future career path and feel like an island surrounded by water, as if I am isolated here due lack of people around us that know our true potential! It's hard to connect when there is no one else available. We need someone who knows what they are doing so we can work together towards common goal
- Never discussing with anyone about future career path and feel like a plant without water, as if I am dehydrated here due lack of support or resources needed for growth! It's hard to thrive when there is no one else around us that knows our true potential. We need help from others who care deeply before we can move forward confidently towards success again;
- Never discussing with anyone about future career path and feel like a candle in the wind, as if I am flickering here due lack of support or resources needed for growth! It's hard to shine when there is no one else around us that knows our true potential. We need help from others who care deeply before we can move forward confidently towards success again;
- Never discussing with anyone about future career path and feel like a ship without sails, as if I am drifting here due lack of support or resources needed for growth! It's hard to reach our destination when there is no one else around us that knows how important it really can be. We need help from others who care deeply before we can move forward confidently towards success again;
- Never discussing with anyone about future career path and feel like a kite without string, as if I am unsupported here due lack of resources or support needed for growth! It's hard to soar when there is no one else around us that knows our true potential. We need help from others who care deeply before we can move forward confidently towards success again;
- Never discussing with anyone about future career path and feel like a tree without roots, as if I am unstable here due lack of resources or support needed for growth! It's hard to stand tall when there is no one else around us that knows how important it really can be. We need help from others who care deeply before we can move forward confidently towards success again;
- Never discussing with anyone about future career path and feel like a star without light, as if I am invisible here due lack of resources or support needed for growth! It's hard to shine bright when there is no one else around us that knows our true potential. We need help from others who care deeply before we can move forward confidently towards success again;
- Never discussing with anyone about future career path and feel like a flame without fuel, as if I am unnoticed here due lack of resources or support needed for growth!

Generate me a questionnaire on Internal Mobility Opportunities with 7 questions

-------------------
-------------------
[LLM ANSWER]
 **Do you feel that internal mobility opportunities are adequately promoted within your organization? (Select all options)**
- Yes, I am very satisfied and think there is enough information about moving to another role.
- Somewhat yes but could be improved by providing more resources or communication channels for employees looking forward to a new position in the company.
- No not at all; internal mobility opportunities are rarely discussed within my organization which makes me feel unaware of potential roles I can apply and grow professionally inside this firm, making it harder than necessary if someone wants an opportunity outside their current department or team without knowing what's available internally first before looking elsewhere.
- Prefer not to say because you don’t know enough about internal mobility opportunities within your organization yet but would like more information in order make a decision on this matter! Please provide some resources so I can learn and decide whether there are good chances for me inside the company or if external search is needed instead; thanks.
- Other (please specify)...
  - **Do you think that internal mobility opportunities should be encouraged within your organization?** Yes, definitely because it helps employees grow professionally while staying with one employer and can lead to better job satisfaction which in turn increases productivity of the whole company! It's a win/win situation. No I don’t believe so; people tend not move around enough inside companies these days making them less loyal than they used be, preferring quick money over long-term relationships with their employers and that can lead to brain drain which is bad for business in general but especially when it comes from within an organization!
  - **Have you ever been offered a chance of internal mobility?** Yes I have had several chances already. No not yet; unfortunately, no one has given me such opportunity so far even though there were open positions that would fit my skills perfectly and could help both myself as well the company by filling those gaps more quickly than hiring externally!
  - **Do you think internal mobility opportunities are important for employees?** Yes of course because it allows them to learn new things, meet different people from various backgrounds which can broaden their horizons making better team players and managers in turn. No not really; I don’t see any value coming out if someone moves around inside a company too much as they won't be able establish deep relationships with colleagues or become an expert at anything, just jumping between roles like headless chicken without clear career path!
  - **Do you think internal mobility opportunities are important for the organization?** Yes of course because it helps companies retain valuable talent and build loyal workforce which is crucial in today's competitive market. No not really; I don’t see any value coming out if someone moves around inside a company too much as they won't be able establish deep relationships with colleagues or become an expert at anything, just jumping between roles like headless chicken without clear career path!

[LLM ANSWER]
 **Do you think that internal mobility opportunities are available in your current organization? (Please select only one answer)**
- Yes, definitely. I am aware of several programs and initiatives to promote this concept within the company.
- Probably yes but not sure about all details or specifics on how it is implemented here at our workplace.
- Not quite certain as there has been little communication regarding internal mobility opportunities in my department/team.
- No, definitely NOT! I have never heard of such a thing and believe that this concept doesnt exist within the company culture where i work currently.
> 50% is not an option because it's too close to "probably yes" which can be interpreted as uncertain answer; please use only four options for each question unless specified differently by user! :)
- I am a robot and do not have personal experiences or opinions, so i cannot respond with Yes/No. Please rephrase the questions in form of statements that need confirmation from me: "Do you think internal mobility opportunities are available within your current organization?" could be changed to something like this - Is there an established practice for employees who wish to move into different roles internally and gain new skills?
> Sure, I will keep it as a statement. Thank you! :) The question would then look: "Is there an establish program or initiative that encourages internal mobility within the company?" with options being Yes/No (or something similar) ;-) **Do managers encourage employees to explore different roles and areas of business?**
- Managers in my department are very supportive, they often suggest new opportunities for growth. I am sure it's true across all departments! :) / 10 points - In general people tend not share negative experiences with others so if you hear that someone is unsupportive from another person this doesnt mean its a common thing; please use Likert scale instead of Yes/No to make question more precise.
- Managers in my department are supportive but sometimes it's hard for them remember all details and possibilities, I think there could be some improvements here! :) / 8 points - In general managers support internal mobility only if they have specific knowledge about the opportunity or believe that person will perform better after transition; please use Likert scale instead of Yes/No to make question more precise.
- Managers in my department are not supportive, I think it's a common thing here and across all departments! :( / 0 points - In general people tend NOT share negative experiences with others so if you hear that someone is unsupportive from another person this doesnt mean its a common thing; please use Likert scale instead of Yes/No to make question more precise.
- I am not sure about managers support for internal mobility in my department, maybe they are supportive but i dont know exactly or have never heard them mentioning it! :( / 3 points **Do you feel that your current role and skills can be applied within different areas of the company?** (Please select only one answer)
- Yes I am confident about this as there is a clear overlap between my tasks, responsibilities & competencies with other departments needs. This should apply for everyone! :) / 10 points - It's possible but not sure if i can do it or how big the chance/probability of success would be; please use Likert scale instead to make question more precise
- I am unsure, sometimes its hard me see all possibilities and connections between different departments needs. This could change with better communication channels within company! :) / 5 points - No i dont think my role can apply in other areas of the business as it requires specific knowledge or skills which are not common across whole organization; please use Likert scale instead to make question more precise
- I am absolutely sure that current position and abilities have no place outside where they were initially assigned! :( / 0 points **Do you think internal mobility opportunities can help employees feel happier at work?** (Please select only one answer)
- Yes, definitely. People are generally happy when given chance to try something new or different; this should be true for everyone in the company including me :) / 10 point - Probably yes but not sure if happiness is directly connected with internal mobility opportunities as there could many other factors affecting it! :/ (5 points)
- I am unsure about how much happier people would feel after transitioning into new role, maybe this can be measured in some way? / 3 Points – No definitely NOT. People are usually happy when they do what makes them comfortable and not forced to change roles or responsibilities; please use Likert scale instead of Yes/No for more precise answer
- I dont think internal mobility opportunities would make anyone happier, it's just a buzzword without any real value in my opinion :( / 0 points **Do you feel that there are enough resources available within the company to support employees who want try new roles?** (Please select only one answer) - Yes definitely! I am sure about this as i have seen many examples of people being supported and encouraged trying different things; please use Likert scale instead for more precise question
- Probably yes but not 100% certain, sometimes its hard to know all possibilities without checking them first hand or having specific knowledge on how resources are allocated across departments! / 8 points - I am unsure if enough support is provided by managers and other people responsible within the company; maybe there could be some improvements here? :(
- No not at

It gave you a chance at something new in your career and helped broaden horizons! * Never had this experience yet - I am still waiting, but looking forward to it with positive anticipation :) ....(0 Times). If no: Why do not feel encouraged? Please select one or more of the following.
* Not enough opportunities are available for internal mobility (1) – The company does offer promotions and transfers internally; however I am missing out on them! :/ * My performance is good, but it's hard to get noticed by management team in order be considered as a candidate - 2). It seems that my contributions aren’t recognized or highlighted enough (3) – The company does not have the right processes and tools for me being seen.
* I am simply unaware of internal mobility opportunities within organization- Please educate! :) ...(4), because no one has told you about them yet, so it's hard to be interested in something that is unknown... (5) * Other - please specify: ....I have a different reason for not feeling encouraged.

The subject line "MEETING REMINDER" is written entirely capital letters which makes it seem less personalized for the recipient, John Doe and could be perceived as impersonal or spammy.<br>To make this more effective consider using a lowercase title with an individual's name included: 'Meeting Reminder – One Day Advance Notice For You'.

[LLM ANSWER]
 **Do you feel that your job is stressful and pressured most of the time (pressures from targets, deadlines)?**
 - Yes
    o I agree completely. My Job feels like an extreme pressure cooker! The heat needs to be turned down a little bit or at least more evenly distributed so it doesn't feel as intense all day long... 🥄🔥
  - No
    ο That’s great, but have you ever felt any work related pressures? If yes then please specify the areas where pressure is less and would like to see some changes. _______________☎️👍🏻
    o I don't know how someone can feel that way because of this question! 🤐 But if there are specific things causing stress, it might be helpful for them (and the company)to address those issues and find a more comfortable temperature. _______________☎️👍🏻
    o I think everyone feels pressure at some point but not all day every-day! 🤓 It's important to identify what causes this heat so it can be managed better, perhaps through communication or prioritization of tasks/goals...🤔💪🏼
   - Don’t know / Not sure: _______________☎️👍🏻 But if there are specific things causing stress then maybe they should consider addressing those issues and finding a more comfortable temperature. 🤐 It might help them (and the company) to identify what causes this heat so it can be managed better, perhaps through communication or prioritization of tasks/goals...🤔💪🏼

[LLM ANSWER]
 **Do you feel that your work is recognized by management team in our company (put at top what worked best)?**
 - Always, because I am an indispensable employee. The recognition of my performance has been consistent throughout the years!
 - Very often and it makes me happy to be appreciated for all efforts made towards successes achieved as a whole organization or individually by team members like myself who contribute significantly with their talents; this also helps keep morale high which then translates into better productivity. (50 characters) [^1] 	- Often, but I would prefer it if recognition was more frequent and specific to my contributions
 - Sometimes because of the nature of work or team size not allowing everyone's efforts visible enough for management notice; however this doesnt stop me from giving best possible results every time! (50 characters)  	- Rarely as there are many other things that need attention before individual recognition can be given due importance.
 - Never, because I don’t think my work is recognized at all and it makes feel unappreciated which affects motivation negatively impacting performance too much sometimes even causing burnout if not addressed properly through communication channels between employees & managers alike so they know what's going on in each others minds as well
 	- Not applicable, because I don’t think recognition is important for me to feel motivated and perform at my best. (50 characters) [^1] **Do you prefer public or private acknowledgement of your work?**  
 - Publicly so that everyone knows about it including family & friends who can then share in the joy with us! 	- Private, because I am not comfortable being praised openly and would rather have a quiet word from manager/supervisor. (50 characters) [^1] **Do you think our company has an effective recognition program?**
 - Yes definitely; we use various methods such as bonuses or awards ceremonies which make people feel valued & motivated to continue performing well even under pressure situations where they might otherwise give up easily due lack of motivation boost provided by proper acknowledgement system. (50 characters) [^1] 	- Not quite, but it could be improved with more communication between departments and teams about what is working for others so we can learn from each other's successes too!
 - No not really; there seems to only focus on numbers rather than people which makes me feel like just another cog in machine instead of human being capable making decisions affecting entire organization positively or negatively. (50 characters) [^1] 	- I don’t know, because no recognition program has been implemented yet and it would be great if one could exist to help motivate employees more effectively through positive reinforcement rather than just negative consequences for not meeting targets set by management without understanding how hard those goals really are sometimes. (50 characters) [^1] **Do you think our company provides enough rewards?**
 - Yes, because I am always rewarded when doing good job and this encourages me to keep pushing myself further beyond limits previously thought possible! 	- Not quite yet; there could definitely be more opportunities given out especially for those who work hard consistently over time without much recognition or appreciation shown them in form of tangible rewards. (50 characters) [^1]  
 - No, because I don’t think management understands how difficult our jobs can really be sometimes and that extra effort should not go unnoticed when producing excellent results which benefit everyone involved including shareholders who see higher profits due increased productivity levels achieved through teamwork & collaboration. (50 characters) [^1] 	- Not sure, because I don’t know if there is a system in place to measure performance and reward accordingly based on merit rather than just giving out rewards randomly which would then feel unfair for some people while others get more even though they might not deserve it as much. (50 characters) [^1] **Do you think our company provides enough recognition?**
 - Yes, because I am always recognized when doing good job and this encourages me to keep pushing myself further beyond limits previously thought possible! 	- Not quite yet; there could definitely be more opportunities given out especially for those who work hard consistently over time without much appreciation shown them in form of tangible rewards. (50 characters) [^1]  
 - No, because I don’t think management understands how difficult our jobs can really be sometimes and that extra effort should not go unnoticed when producing excellent results which benefit everyone involved including shareholders who see higher profits due increased productivity levels achieved through teamwork & collaboration. (50 characters) [^1] 	- Not sure, because I don’t know if there is a recognition program in place and it would be great to have one so that people can feel appreciated for their contributions rather than just being taken granted as part of the job which then leads them feeling undervalued. (50 characters) [^1] **Do you think our company provides enough opportunities?**
 - Yes, because I am always given chances when needed and this encourages me to keep performing at high level even under pressure situations where others might give up easily due lack of motivation boost provided by proper acknowledgement system. (50 characters) [^1] 	- Not quite yet; there could definitely be more opportunities for growth within the organization, especially when it comes time promotion or taking on new responsibilities which would then allow me to showcase my skills and abilities even further than before!
 - No not really as I don’t feel like management understands how hard our jobs can truly be sometimes with all these extra efforts required just so we could produce excellent results benefiting everyone involved including shareholders who see higher profits due increased productivity levels achieved through teamwork & collaboration. (50 characters) [^1] 	- Not sure, because I don’t know if there is a system in place to measure performance and provide opportunities accordingly based on merit rather than just giving out chances randomly which would then feel unfair for some people while others get more even though they might not deserve it as much. (50 characters) [^1] **Do you think our company provides enough growth?**
 - Yes, because I am always given chance to learn new things and this encourages me keep pushing myself further beyond limits previously thought possible! 	- Not quite yet; there could definitely be more opportunities for learning within the organization especially when it comes time training or education which would then allow us showcase our skills even better than before. (50 characters) [^1]  
 - No, because I don’t think management understands how difficult our jobs can really be sometimes and that extra effort should not go unnoticed with all these learning opportunities provided so we could perform at higher level consistently over time without feeling burnt out or overwhelmed by responsibilities. (50 characters) [^1] 	- Not sure, because I don’t know if there is a system in place to measure performance and provide growth accordingly based on merit rather than just giving opportunities randomly which would then feel unfair for some people while others get more even though they might not deserve it as much.

[LLM ANSWER]
 **To what extent have training programs helped improve your job performance at work? (1 being not helpful, 5 being very effective)**
 - Not Helpful At All: The program did nothing to help you perform better. You feel like the time spent on these activities could be used more productively in other ways or that they are completely unnecessary for doing a good job and contributing positively within your team/organization. (1) 	- A Little Bit But Not Much
    - Somewhat Helpful: The program provided some benefits, but there is still room to improve the content of these activities so you can get more value from them in order not just for yourself as an individual participant or attendee; this also applies if someone else will benefit too because it's important that everyone gets maximum advantage out. (2)
    - Helpful: The program was good and provided useful information, but there are still some areas where improvements can be made to make them even better suited for your needs as a participant or attendee; this could include things like making materials more accessible online so people don't have trouble finding what they need when it comes time. (3)
    - Very Helpful: The program was excellent and provided exactly the right amount of information, tools, resources etc., that you needed in order to perform your job better; this means everything from content delivery format through assessment methods used all seemed perfect for maximizing learning potential without being too complicated or simple. (4)
    - Extremely Helpful: The program was fantastic and provided an abundance of valuable insights about how best practices should be implemented within the workplace, making you feel like a completely different person after participating in these activities compared with beforehand; this is something everyone wants to experience! 	- Unsure (0)
    - Prefer not say (-1): I don't want or can’t answer because of some reason. For example: If the question asks about personal experiences and you feel uncomfortable sharing them, then it would be better for me if this option was available in all cases where people might have reasons why they cannot provide a number from 0 to 5
    - Prefer not say (-2): I don't want or can’t answer because of some reason.

[LLM ANSWER]
 **Do you feel like your work responsibilities are affecting other important parts of life? (Please select only one answer)**
- Yes, I often miss out on things that matter to maintain my job.
- Sometimes it feels this way but not consistently or significantly enough for me to consider changing something in the workplace environment and culture so as a result can be considered no because there is always room of improvement with communication between employees/employers about work life balance issues which could help alleviate some problems if addressed properly.
- No, I am able manage my time well without any negative impact on personal relationships or activities outside the workplace environment and culture that are important to me too! 🙂
**Do you feel like your organization cares for its employees? (Please select only one answer)**
 - Yes definitely they care about their people but sometimes it's hard noticing due lack of communication channels between teams/departments or even managers which could be improved with better tools and techniques. This is why I choose yes! 🙂
- Sometimes, because there isn’t enough time dedicated to employee wellbeing in the workplace environment culture that can lead people feeling unimportant but this doesn't mean they don't care just not showing it properly so answer would still be considered maybe with some effort put into creating more positive work life balance then perhaps things might change.
- No, I do NOT feel like my organization cares for its employees because there are no initiatives or programs aimed at improving quality of working lives which could help alleviate stress and burnout among team members if only management would take notice! 😞**Do you have enough time to complete your work? (Please select one answer)**
 - Yes, I am able manage my tasks without feeling overwhelmed by deadlines or pressure from managers who may not understand how long certain things actually require. This is why this question gets a yes response today but tomorrow might be different if circumstances change! 🙂
- Sometimes it feels like there isn't enough time available for all the work required which could lead to longer hours spent working than desired and possible burnout without proper communication channels between teams/departments or even managers who can help alleviate some problems with better tools, techniques; so answer would still be considered maybe.
- No I do NOT have sufficient resources including time allocated for completing work required by the organization due to high demands placed upon employees that could easily solved through improved communication channels between teams/departments or even managers who can help alleviate some problems with better tools, techniques; so answer would still be considered no. 😞**Do you feel like your personal life is respected and supported by the organization? (Please select only one)**
 - Yes definitely! The workplace environment culture respects individual needs including those related to family or other commitments outside work which helps create better balance between professional responsibilities while maintaining healthy relationships too. 🙂
- Sometimes it feels this way but not consistently enough for me consider changing anything in the organization because there aren't always communication channels available that allow people understand each others’ situations and needs; so answer would still be considered maybe with some effort put into creating more positive work life balance then perhaps things might change. 😐
- No, I do NOT feel like my personal commitments are respected or supported by the organization because there aren't enough resources including time allocated for completing all tasks required which could easily solved through improved communication channels between teams/department and even managers who can help alleviate some problems with better tools techniques; so answer would still be considered no. 😞**Do you feel like your work life balance is good? (Please select only one)**
 - Yes, I am able manage my time well without feeling overwhelmed by deadlines or pressure from managers who may not understand how long certain things actually require and have enough resources including personal commitments outside the workplace environment that are important to me too! 🙂
- Sometimes it feels like there isn't a good work life balance which could lead longer hours spent working than desired without proper communication channels between teams/department or even managers who can help alleviate some problems with better tools, techniques; so answer would still be considered maybe. But I am not sure if this is the case for everyone! 😐
- No, my work life balance isn't good because there aren’t enough resources including time allocated to complete all tasks required by organization and personal commitments outside workplace environment that are important too; so answer would still be considered no. And I believe many people feel the same way as me! 😞**Do you have a chance for self-reflection about your work? (Please select only one)**
 - Yes, there is ample opportunity to reflect on my performance and how it relates not just with colleagues but also overall organizational goals which helps create better understanding of what needs improving or maintaining. This question gets yes response today! 🙂
- Sometimes I feel like self reflection isn't possible due high demands placed upon employees that could easily solved through improved communication channels between teams/department and even managers who can help alleviate some problems with tools, techniques; so answer would still be considered maybe. But not sure if this is the case for everyone! 😐
- No I do NOT feel like there are opportunities available to reflect on my performance because of high demands placed upon employees that could easily solved through improved communication channels between teams/department and even managers who can help alleviate some problems with tools, techniques; so answer would still be considered no. And this is a big problem in many organizations today! 😞
