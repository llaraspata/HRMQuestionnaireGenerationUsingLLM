 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.

            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.

            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.

This is a questionnaire about job satisfaction and I have extracted the questions. The questions are in the "questions" key and each question is an object with a "text" property and a "code" property. The code property is not used in this questionnaire. I have also extracted the "displayOrder" property because it was used to order the questions.

Here is a summary of the questionnaire:

- The questionnaire is about job satisfaction.
- There are 14 questions in the questionnaire.
- Each question is an object with a "text" property and a "code" property. The code property is not used in this questionnaire.
- I have extracted the "displayOrder" property because it was used to order the questions.
- Here is the list of questions in order of displayOrder:

1. Do you feel motivated to perform your best at work?
2. Do you feel like your current job allows you to express yourself creatively?
3. Do you feel motivated to do a good job?
4. Do you feel like you have to hide your true feelings at work?
5. Do you feel like you have to hide your true personality at work?
6. Do you feel like your job is secure?
7. Are you able to be yourself at work?
8. Do you feel like your opinions are taken into consideration at work?
9. Do you feel like your work is valued and appreciated?
10. Do you feel like you have enough information to do your job well?
11. Do you feel like you have to be careful about what you say at work?
12. Do you feel like you have to be someone else at work?
13. Do you feel like your talents are being used in your job?
14. Do you feel like you have enough authority to do your job well?

Again, here is the JSON representation of the questionnaire:

If the user does not specify a valid topic, reply with "Sorry I cant help you".
If the topic is valid, reply with only a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.

If the user does not specify a valid topic, reply with "Sorry I cant help you".
If the topic is valid, reply with only a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.
 - ID: 4, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to aquire feedback.

      This is a list of questions about job satisfaction. Each question is represented as a dictionary with the following format:
      {"CODE": The unique identifier for the question,
      "NAME": The actual question, and
      "DISPLAY_ORDER": The order in which the question should be displayed, and
      "_TF_ANSWERS": A list of dictionaries for each possible answer, where each dictionary has a "text" property and a "value" property. "text" is the actual answer and "value" is a unique identifier for that answer.

      To convert this list into a more readable format, please do the following:
      1. For each question, use the "NAME" property as the actual question.
      2. For each question, use the "DISPLAY_ORDER" property to determine the order in which the questions should be displayed.
      3. For each question, take the "_TF_ANSWERS" list and:
      a. Create a new list of dictionaries for each possible answer.
      b. Use the "text" property of each "_TF_ANSWERS" dictionary as the actual answer.
      c. Use the "value" property of each "_TF_ANSWERS" dictionary as a unique identifier for that answer.

      Here is an example of how the first question should look after it has been converted to a more readable format:

In this JSON object, there are eight questions about workplace culture. Each question has a code, name, and type ID. The type ID is 3, which indicates that it is a Likert scale question. The name of each question is a statement about workplace culture, and the code is a unique identifier.

Question 1 asks whether the workplace is inclusive and diverse. Question 2 asks whether the organization provides adequate opportunities for growth and development. Question 3 asks whether the workplace fosters a sense of community and teamwork. Question 4 asks whether the organization values and respects its employees. Question 5 asks whether the workplace culture is supportive and understanding. Question 6 asks whether the workplace encourages and facilitates work-life balance. Question 7 asks whether the workplace culture is generally supportive. And question 8 asks whether the workplace is a positive environment that encourages employees to be their best selves.
```

This is a valid JSON object that describes a survey about workplace culture. Each question is presented as a statement, and respondents are asked to rate their agreement with the statement on a Likert scale. The questions cover a range of aspects of workplace culture, such as inclusivity, growth opportunities, teamwork, and supportiveness. The code for each question can be used to link responses to specific questions, and the display order can be used to order the questions in a particular way on a survey.
