I have generated a questionnaire on Career Development with 14 questions. Here are the details:
- The code for this Questionnaire will be 'CAREER_DEV'.
- Each of these Questions has been assigned an ID, Display Order and Type based upon your specifications in order to make it easy to reference them if needed later. For example using Q2 instead of its full name "Do you feel that your current role aligns with long term career goals?" will be easier for someone who is processing the responses or referring back to these questions at a future time
- The Type ID 1 has been used in all cases here as it was not specified which types should be included. If this questionnaire needs more specific Types, please let me know and I can adjust them accordingly next time! Let's call my friend Q2 again: "Do you feel that your current role aligns with long term career goals?" has Type ID 1
- Questions marked as 'DISPLAY_ORDER':3 are asking about the employee’s feelings towards their employer, while questions at Display Order of 5 and above focus on more general topics. This is because we want to ensure employees feel comfortable answering these sensitive but important evaluation style questionnaires! And finally... The last three Questions (Q10-Q12) are asking about continuous education & training for career growth with Type ID: 2

```python
This questionnaire has seven questions related to Career Path Clarity. The first three options are Yes, Somewhat yes or No for each statement with a type_id value 2 which means that there is no right answer among the choices but just asking whether they agree and if not how much do you disagree from this concept of career path clarity
The fourth question has only two answers as it's more about providing information to employees regarding their potential future roles in an organization. The last three questions are also with type_id value 2 which means that there is no right answer among the choices but just asking whether they agree or not from this concept of career path clarity

If the topic is valid, reply with only a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.
 - ID: 2, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one or more answer from a list.
 - ID: 3, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to rate something.

If the topic is valid, reply with only a JSON, which must respect the following format:
 - The root of the JSON is an object that contains a single property 'data'.
        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.

            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.

        - The 'data' property is an object that contains a single property 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES'.
        - 'TF_QUESTIONNAIRES' is an array of only one element, which represents a questionnaire. It has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the questionnaire's code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the questionnaire's name.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) which is equal to 3.
            - '_TF_QUESTIONS': An array of objects, each representing a question.
        - Each question in the '_TF_QUESTIONS' array has the following properties:
            - 'CODE': (string) the question's unique code.
            - 'NAME': (string) the question's content.
            - 'TYPE_ID': (int) the question's type.
            - 'DISPLAY_ORDER': (int) the question's display order.
            - '_TF_ANSWERS': An array of objects, each representing a possible answer to the question.
        - Each answer object in the '_TF_ANSWERS' array has a single property 'ANSWER', which is a string representing the content of the answer.
The admitted question's types are the following:
 - ID: 1, DESCRIPTION: Use this type of question to choose one answer from a list.

Please note the following about this questionnaire on Leadership Effectiveness with seven questions. Each one has an associated code, name (question), type id and display order for ease of use in a digital format or manual data collection process if needed by your organization to evaluate leadership effectiveness within it: 1) The first leader is asked whether they feel the person leading them can inspire their team through clear communication; this question evaluates inspiration abilities.
2) Second, understanding how employees perceive current management styles and ability in adapting with different situations are evaluated using a flexible scale from one to five points where three indicates neutrality or not being able to judge while higher scores indicate positive feelings about adaptability of leadership style 3). Thirdly: Is the leader's communication clear, concise? This question evaluates clarity and precision in delivering messages.
4) Fourth Question is designed around trust-building capabilities; does your current supervisor establish a sense of confidence within their team members by being open for feedback or suggestions from employees on how things could be improved with higher scores indicating stronger levels 5). Fifth: Ability to create positive work environment where people feel comfortable working together towards common goals.
6) Sixth Question is about receptiveness and willingness in receiving constructive criticism, which helps leaders grow personally as well professionally when they are open for feedback from team members around them; this question evaluates whether or not the leader's door remains always "open" to hear others 7). Lastly: Ability of a good manager/supervisor is evaluated through their capacity in creating an environment where people feel safe and secure, freeing any kind negative influence on productivity.
This set contains seven questions with associated codes that can be used for evaluation purposes if needed by your organization or simply as part of self-reflection process during leadership development journey!
