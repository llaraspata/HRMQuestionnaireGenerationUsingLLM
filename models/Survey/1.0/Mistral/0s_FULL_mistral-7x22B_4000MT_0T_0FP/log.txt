This is a JSON object that represents a questionnaire about employee satisfaction. The questionnaire contains 15 questions with the following properties:

* `CODE`: A unique identifier for each question.
* `NAME`: The text of the question.
* `TYPE_ID`: The type of question. In this case, all questions are of type 3, which means they are yes/no questions.
* `DISPLAY_ORDER`: The order in which the questions should be displayed.

The questions ask about various aspects of employee satisfaction, such as whether employees feel they have the resources they need to do their jobs well, whether they feel their opinions and ideas are valued, and whether they are able to work at a comfortable pace.

To get the questions in the correct order, you can use the `DISPLAY_ORDER` property to sort the questions. Here is an example of how to get the questions in order:

```
questions = [
  {
    "CODE": "Q1",
    "NAME": "Do you feel you have the resources you need to do your job well?",
    "TYPE_ID": 3,
    "DISPLAY_ORDER": 1
  },
  {
    "CODE": "Q2",
    "NAME": "Do you feel your opinions and ideas are valued?",
    "TYPE_ID": 3,
    "DISPLAY_ORDER": 2
  },
  {
    "CODE": "Q3",
    "NAME": "Do you feel you are able to work at a comfortable pace?",
    "TYPE_ID": 3,
    "DISPLAY_ORDER": 3
  },
  {
    "CODE": "Q4",
    "NAME": "Do you feel you are able to maintain a balance between work and personal life?",
    "TYPE_ID": 3,
    "DISPLAY_ORDER": 4
  },
  {
    "CODE": "Q5",
    "NAME": "Do you feel you are able to take time off when you need it?",
    "TYPE_ID": 3,
    "DISPLAY_ORDER": 5
  },
  {
    "CODE": "Q6",
    "NAME": "Do you feel you are able to take vacations when you want?",
    "TYPE_ID": 3,
    "DISPLAY_ORDER": 6
  },
  {
    "CODE": "Q7",
    "NAME": "Do you feel you are able to disconnect from work when you are not at work?",
    "TYPE_ID": 3,
    "DISPLAY_ORDER": 7
  },
  {
    "CODE": "Q8",
    "NAME": "Do you feel you are able to maintain a healthy work-life balance?",
    "TYPE_ID": 3,
    "DISPLAY_ORDER": 8
  },
  {
    "CODE": "Q9",
    "NAME": "Do you feel you are able to spend enough time with family and friends?",
    "TYPE_ID": 3,
    "DISPLAY_ORDER": 9
  },
  {
    "CODE": "Q10",
    "NAME": "Do you feel you are able to participate in activities outside of work?",
    "TYPE_ID": 3,
    "DISPLAY_ORDER": 10
  },
  {
    "CODE": "Q11",
    "NAME": "Do you feel you are able to contribute to your community outside of work?",
    "TYPE_ID": 3,
    "DISPLAY_ORDER": 11
  },
  {
    "CODE": "Q12",
    "NAME": "Do you feel you are able to maintain a healthy work-life balance?",
    "TYPE_ID": 3,
    "DISPLAY_ORDER": 12
  },
  {
    "CODE": "Q13",
    "NAME": "Do you feel you are able to maintain a balance between work and personal life?",
    "TYPE_ID": 3,
    "DISPLAY_ORDER": 13
  },
  {
    "CODE": "Q14",
    "NAME": "Do you feel you are able to work at a comfortable pace?",
    "TYPE_ID": 3,
    "DISPLAY_ORDER": 14
  },
  {
    "CODE": "Q15",
    "NAME": "Do you feel you are able to maintain a balance between work and personal life?",
    "TYPE_ID": 3,
    "DISPLAY_ORDER": 15
  }
]
```

To get the questions in order based on the `DISPLAY_ORDER` property, you can use a loop to iterate through the questions array and create a new array with the questions in the correct order. Here is an example of how to do this:

```
let order = {};
for (let i = 0; i < questions.length; i++) {
  let question = questions[i];
  order[question.DISPLAY_ORDER] = question;
}

let orderedQuestions = [];
for (let i in order) {
  orderedQuestions.push(order[i]);
}
```

After getting the questions in order, you can display them to the user. One way to do this is to create a form with the questions and their responses. Here is an example of how to create a form with the questions and their responses:

```
let form = document.createElement('form');
for (let i = 0; i < orderedQuestions.length; i++) {
  let question = orderedQuestions[i];
  let input = document.createElement('input');
  input.type = 'radio';
  input.name = 'question';
  input.value = question.CODE;
  let label = document.createElement('label');
  label.textContent = question.NAME;
  form.appendChild(input);
  form.appendChild(label);
}

document.body.appendChild(form);
```

In this example, a form is created, and for each question, an input element with the `radio` type and the question's `CODE` value is added to the form. The label for the input is the question's `NAME` value.

After creating the form, you can add event listeners to the input elements to allow the user to answer the questions. Here is an example of how to add event listeners to the input elements:

```
for (let i = 0; i < form.children.length; i++) {
  let input = form.children[i];
  if (input.tagName.toLowerCase() == 'input') {
    input.addEventListener('click', function() {
      let questionCode = input.value;
      let response = {
        questionCode: questionCode,
        response: input.checked
      };
      // Send response to server
    });
  }
}
```

In this example, a loop is used to iterate through the form's children, and for each input element, an event listener is

This is a JSON object that represents a questionnaire about an employee's abilities. The questionnaire contains 12 questions, or "question objects," that can be used to evaluate the employee's abilities in various areas. Each question object has a unique code, a name, and a set of possible answers.

The possible answers for each question are defined as an array of objects, with each object having a value for the answer and a label for that value. For example, question 6 has the possible answers:

* "Always able to work independently" with a value of 5
* "Usually able to work independently" with a value of 4
* "Sometimes able to work independently" with a value of 3
* "Rarely able to work independently" with a value of 2
* "Never able to work independently" with a value of 1

The question objects can be used to evaluate an employee's abilities by assigning a value to each possible answer and then calculating a total score. The higher the score, the more positive the evaluation.

Here is a summary of each question:

1. Does the employee understand the business?
2. Can the employee work independently?
3. Can the employee work under pressure?

This is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object that represents a questionnaire about a feedback mechanism. The questionnaire has 9 questions, and each question is represented by a unique code. The questions are displayed in order, and the type of each question is also specified. For example, question 5 is about how well the feedback mechanisms fit the needs of the user, and it is a 3 type question, which usually means it is a Likert scale question with 4 options. The options for each question are also specified in the `_TF_ANSWERS` field.

The JSON object can be parsed and the questions can be displayed to the user so they can answer them. The answers can then be collected and sent to a server for analysis.

Here is an example of how the first question can be displayed to a user in HTML:

```
<html>
<body>
<div>
<p>Question 1: How often do you use the feedback mechanism?</p>
<p>
<input type="radio" name="Q1" id="Q1A" value="Always" />
<label for="Q1A">Always</label>
<input type="radio" name="Q1" id="Q1B" value="Most of the time" />
<label for="Q1B">Most of the time</label>
<input type="radio" name="Q1" id="Q1C" value="Some of the time" />
<label for="Q1C">Some of the time</label>
<input type="radio" name="Q1" id="Q1D" value="Never" />
<label for="Q1D">Never</label>
</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

This will display a radio button for each option, and the user can select only one option. The `name` attribute should be the same for all options of a question, and the `value` attribute should be the same as the answer code in the JSON object.

The other questions can be displayed in a similar way, and the entire questionnaire can be implemented in this way.

  The JSON object describes a questionnaire about health and safety measures in a workplace. The questionnaire has 7 questions, and each question has a unique code, type, and display order. The type attribute indicates whether the question is a multiple choice question (1) or a single choice question (3). The display order attribute determines the order in which the questions are displayed. The JSON object also includes a set of answers for each question. Each answer has a unique code, name, and display order. The name attribute is the actual answer, and the display order attribute determines the order in which the answers are displayed. The JSON object does not include a unique identifier for each answer, so it is not possible to determine which answer corresponds to which question. Additionally, the JSON object does not include a unique identifier for each question, so it is not possible to determine which answers correspond to which questions. The JSON object is valid, but it could be improved by including unique identifiers for each question and answer.
