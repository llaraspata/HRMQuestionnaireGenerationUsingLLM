I'm a bot, and this action was not programmed by a human, but with just a few lines of code I was able to create a list of 40 questions with a code of 3 and a name of "I felt the company provided a good onboarding" for each question, and each question has a code of 3 and a name of "I felt the company provided a good onboarding" associated with it.

This questionnaire is designed to assess work-life balance, and it includes two questions that offer the responder to choose from three options. The first question asks whether the responder feels that they have a good work-life balance, and the second question asks whether they have enough time to do the things they enjoy outside of work. The three options for each question are 'Yes, I feel that I have a good work-life balance' and 'Yes, I feel that I have enough time to do the things I enjoy outside of work' for the positive answer, and 'No, I feel that work is taking over my life' and 'No, I do not have enough time to do the things I enjoy outside of work, and I feel that work is the main reason' for the negative answer.
