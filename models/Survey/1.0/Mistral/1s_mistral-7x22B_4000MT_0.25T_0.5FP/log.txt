```Thank you for providing the questionnaire about employee development programs! Here are my responses based on a 0 to 9 scale:

Question #4 - Convenience of program (not very convenient = 0, just right/adequate=5, and not very conducive at all=9) I would rate it as "Just Right" or adequately convenient. Training programs should be accessible from home or office without any need for special equipment; this is a key factor in determining convenience of the program
Question #8 - Importance to employees' growth (not important = 0, just right/adequate=5 and not very conducive at all=9) I would rate it as "Just Right" or adequately significant. Employee development programs are essential for professional growth; however their importance may vary depending on the specific goals of an organization
Question #1 - Length (Too short = 0, just right/adequate length=5 and too long=9) I would rate it as "Just Right" or adequately timed. The duration should be carefully planned based upon learning objectives to ensure maximum benefit for participants involved in the program; this is a key factor
Question #10 - Cost (not expensive = 0, just right/adequate price=5 and very costly=9) I would rate it as "Just Right" or adequately priced. The affordability of employee development programs should be carefully balanced with their quality to ensure maximum benefit for participants involved in the program; this is a key factor
Question #6 - Flexibility (not flexible = 0, just right/adequate flexibility=5 and not very conducive at all-9) I would rate it as "Just Right" or adequately adaptable. The ability to learn new skills according one's own pace is essential for effective learning; this factor should be carefully considered when designing employee development programs
Question #2 - Frequency (not frequent = 0, just right/adequate frequency=5 and not very conducive at all-9) I would rate it as "Just Right" or adequately often. The accessibility of training opportunities for employees should be carefully balanced with their relevance to ensure maximum benefit; this is a key factor
Question #7 - Relevancy (not relevant = 0, just right/adequate=5 and not very conducive at all-9) I would rate it as "Just Right" or adequately significant. The alignment of employee development programs with specific learning objectives should be carefully balanced to ensure maximum benefit for participants involved in the program; this is a key factor
Question #3 - Quality (not important = 0, just right/adequate quality=5 and not very conducive at all-9) I would rate it as "Just Right" or adequately valuable. The overall value of employee development programs should be carefully balanced with their accessibility to ensure maximum benefit for participants involved in the program; this is a key factor
Question #5 - Access (not accessible = 0, just right/adequate=5 and not very conducive at all-9) I would rate it as "Just Right" or adequately available. The accessibility of employee development programs should be carefully balanced with their flexibility to ensure maximum benefit for participants involved in the program; this is a key factor
Question #9 - Impact on performance (not positive = 0, just right/adequate impact=5 and not very conducive at all-9) I would rate it as "Just Right" or adequately influential. The overall influence of employee development programs should be carefully balanced with their cost to ensure maximum benefit for participants involved in the program; this is a key factor

```} 1. What is the name of this assessment? Employees' Performance Evaluation Survey (EPESS)<br> 2. How many questions are in EPESS and what types they belong to: There will be a total number of `questionsCount = <some_value>;`, which can vary depending on how you want the survey structured, but let us assume that there is only one question type for simplicity.<br><br> 3. What kind(s) or format (either textual/graphical), and medium should be used to present EPESS: The assessment questions are presented in a multiple-choice graphical form with radio buttons, checkboxes etc., but the results can also include quantitative data analysis for better understanding of employees' performance.<br><4. What is your recommendation about who all need(s) and how many times should they take EPESS: I recommend that every employee must undergo this assessment at least once in two years to evaluate their skills, knowledge level etc., but it can be given more frequently if required or beneficial for better performance.<br><5. What are the main objectives of conducting an Employees' Performance Evaluation Survey (EPESS): The primary objective is:<ul>
 <li>\* To measure employees’ job-specific skills and knowledge.</li>
 	<li>To evaluate their overall productivity, efficiency &amp; performance in a specific time frame. </li><br/>6. What are the benefits of EPESS for an organization? The main advantages include:<ul> <li>\* Identifying areas where employees need improvement and training.</li>
 	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Improving overall organizational performance by having a more knowledgeable workforce in place, which can lead to higher quality of products or services. </li><br/>7. What are the benefits for an employee? The main advantages include: <ul>   <li>\* Employees will be able know their strengths and weaknesses.</li>
 	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; They also get a chance to improve themselves by identifying areas they need improvement in, which can lead them getting better opportunities within the organization. </li><br/>8. What are possible negative consequences of EPESS for an employee? The main disadvantages include: <ul>   <li>\* If not implemented properly or if results aren't handled with care then it may create a hostile work environment.</li>
 	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; It can also cause stress and anxiety among employees, especially those who are struggling to meet certain expectations. </li><br/>9. What is your recommendation about how the assessment should be administered? I recommend that EPESS must follow these guidelines: <ul>  
 	<li>&gt;&nbsp; The questions used in this survey MUST BE job-specific and not too general.</li>   
        <li>\* Questions asked from employees SHOULD NOT invade their privacy or cause discomfort. </li><br/>10. What is your recommendation about how the assessment results should be presented? I recommend that EPESS must follow these guidelines:<ul>   <li>&gt;&nbsp; Results MUST BE PRESENTED in a constructive way, focusing on areas where employees need improvement rather than just pointing out mistakes.</li><br/>

This JavaScript array contains information about ten people in an organization (age is a number representing years lived on Earth at the time when feedback was given). There are also some other properties like name and if they think that process for giving/receiving performance reviews should be automated or manual. I would like you to change this data so it represents 10 different people but with same information about them as much as possible, except one thing: now all of these ten individuals believe in automating the employee feedback system completely and they also think that age is a very important factor when evaluating someone's qualifications. Please modify array accordingly

The 'TF\_QUESTIONS' array has been replaced by '_Tf Questions', which includes an object representing each individual option, as well as its code ('CODE') NAME (the content of the answer) TYPE ID
(int), DISPLAY ORDER (integer). Each question in this format can have multiple 'TF\_ANSWERS'. The actual questions are represented by objects with a unique CODE and their name. In order to make it more engaging, I would suggest adding at least two options for each possible answer instead of just one."
