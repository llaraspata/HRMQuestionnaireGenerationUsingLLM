This is a JSON object that represents a questionnaire about career satisfaction. The questionnaire has 10 questions, each with a unique code and a name. The questions are presented in a list, and each question has a set of possible answers, represented as an object with five possible answers: "Strongly agree", "Agree", "Neutral", "Disagree", and "Strongly disagree". The questions are presented in a way that allows the user to indicate which answer is selected for each person.

The questions in the questionnaire are about how much a person feels in control of their career path, how much they feel like they are progressing, and how much they feel like they are able to shape their own career path. The questions are presented in a way that allows the user to indicate which answer is selected for each person, and the possible answers are presented in a way that allows the user to select only one answer per question.

This questionnaire could be used to measure career satisfaction among a group of people and could provide insights into how satisfied people are with their careers and what factors might be contributing to that satisfaction or dissatisfaction. The questionnaire could also be used to identify areas where people might need more support or resources to feel more satisfied with their careers.

This JSON object represents a questionnaire for evaluating an employee's performance. The questionnaire has 10 questions, each with a unique code and answer options. The answer options are "Always", "Most of the time", "Sometimes" and "Never" for questions about presence and quality, and "Excellent", "Good", "Needs improvement" and "Poor" for questions about problem-solving skills, communication skills, time management skills, etc.

The questionnaire can be used to evaluate an employee's performance based on the answers provided. For example, if an employee's supervisor believes that the employee is always present, communicates well, and solves problems effectively, they can select the answer option "Excellent" for those questions. If the employee is sometimes absent, the supervisor can select "Sometimes" for that question.

The questionnaire can be administered to multiple employees, and the results can be compared to determine which employees are performing better and which areas need improvement. The questionnaire can also be used to set performance goals and identify areas for growth.

This JSON object defines a questionnaire about a feedback mechanism. The questionnaire has nine questions, each with a unique code, and a type identifier. The type identifier for all the questions is 3, which means they are all rated on a Likert scale. The Likert scale is a five or seven point scale for responses, where 1 or 2 could mean "strongly disagree" or "dislike very much", and 5 or 7 could mean "strongly agree" or "like very much". The nine questions ask about the understanding, integration, speed, flexibility, fairness, transparency, and ease of use of the feedback mechanism.

This is a JSON object that represents a questionnaire about work-related pressures. The questionnaire has 14 questions, and each question has a code, display order, and type. The type of each question is "3", which typically indicates a Likert scale question. The questions are about feeling pressure to do certain things, such as maintain a certain work-life balance, stay current with certain technologies, or attend training opportunities. The answers to these questions can help identify work-related pressures and potential areas for improvement.
