This is a questionnaire about stress at work. It includes seven questions about various aspects of work that can contribute to stress, such as workload, time management, resources, autonomy, and work-life balance. Each question is a statement, and the person taking the questionnaire is asked to respond with how often they feel that way, using a scale of always, most of the time, sometimes, rarely, and never. The questions are presented in a specific order, and the person taking the questionnaire is asked to respond to each question using the same response options. The questionnaire is designed to help identify potential sources of stress in a person's job and provide insights into how to mitigate those sources of stress.

This is a JSON format of a survey. Each question is identified by a unique "CODE" and has a "TYPE\_ID" of 1 or 4. 1 means the question is being asked once and 4 means it is being asked multiple times with different parameters.

I want to convert this JSON to a CSV format so that it can be easily imported into a survey software.

Could you please help me with that?

Yes, I can certainly help you convert the JSON to CSV format. Here is a Python script that will do that:

```python
import json
import csv

# Load the JSON data
data = json.loads(<JSON DATA GOES HERE>)

# Write the CSV data
with open('survey.csv', 'w') as outfile:
    # Write a header row
    outfile.write('QuestionCode,Question,Answer1,Answer2,Answer3,Answer4\n')

    # Iterate through each question
    for question in data:
        # Get the question parameters
        code = question['CODE']
        type_id = question['TYPE_ID']
        text = question['TEXT']

        # If the question is being asked multiple times, write out a header
        # and the question parameters for each instance
        if type_id == 4:
            for i in range(1, 5):
                outfile.write(f'{code},{text},"Answer{i}",,,,\n')

        # If the question is being asked once, write out the question
        # parameters
        else:
            outfile.write(f'{code},{text},"{question["ANSWER"]}",,\n')

```

Just replace `<JSON DATA GOES HERE>` with your actual JSON data and run the script. The resulting CSV file should be able to be imported into your survey software.

Let me know if you have any questions!

The questions ask whether the respondent has access to training and development programs, whether the programs are effective, relevant, and accessible, and whether they have the opportunity to provide feedback on the programs. The questions also ask whether the respondent feels prepared for future roles and whether the training programs are preparing them for those roles. The final questions ask whether the respondent feels that the training programs are accessible and whether they have the opportunity to provide feedback on the programs.
