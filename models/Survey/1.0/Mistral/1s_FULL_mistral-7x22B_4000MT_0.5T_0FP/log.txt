This JSON object represents a questionnaire about access to technology and tools. Each question in the questionnaire is an object with a code, name, type, and display order. The type of each question is either 1 (true/false) or 4 (multiple choice with a set of allowed answers). The allowed answers for multiple choice questions are provided in the "_TF\_ANSWERS" field.

The first five questions ask whether the respondent has access to certain technology and tools, and whether those tools are sufficient, comfortable, up-to-date, and reliable. The sixth question asks whether the respondent has access to a computer and internet connection. The seventh question asks whether the respondent has enough training to use the technology and tools effectively. The eighth question asks whether the technology and tools meet accessibility needs. The ninth question asks whether the technology and tools are of good quality. The tenth question asks whether anything else could be done to improve access to technology and tools.

This questionnaire could be used to assess the technology and tools available to employees, students, or other groups of people, and whether those tools are meeting their needs and helping them perform their jobs effectively.

The questions are designed to gauge whether an employee is aware of the internal mobility opportunities available, if they feel the opportunities are evenly distributed, and if they are satisfied with the opportunities offered. The questions also ask if internal mobility is used to keep employees from leaving and to fill leadership positions with internal candidates.

This appears to be a list of questions for a job satisfaction or employee satisfaction survey. The questions are asking about various aspects of job satisfaction, such as job security, opportunities for growth, work-life balance, and relationships with coworkers. It's important for employers to understand how satisfied their employees are with their jobs because satisfied employees are more likely to be engaged and productive. If you're interested in conducting a survey like this, you can use a tool like SurveyMonkey to create and send the questionnaire to your employees.

This questionnaire includes six statements about work-life balance, and the person taking the survey is asked to indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree with each statement. The first three statements are worded in such a way that a person who wants to indicate they have a good work-life balance would agree, and the last three statements are worded in a way that a person who wants to indicate they have a good work-life balance would disagree.

It is important to note that this is just one version of a work-life balance questionnaire, and there may be other versions that ask the questions differently or have different response options. Additionally, work-life balance is a complex and multifaceted concept, and a single questionnaire may not capture all aspects of it.
