This questionnaire includes five questions to assess employee motivation. The first three questions use a Likert scale, while the last two questions are open-ended to allow for more detailed and personal responses. The Likert scale questions use the options "Strongly agree," "Agree," "Neutral," "Disagree," and "Strongly disagree" to provide a more nuanced response. The open-ended questions allow for a more personal response and can provide valuable insights into what motivates each employee.

This appears to be a list of questions in a specific format for a survey. Each question has a code, and then a name and type. The type appears to be 3, which based on context provided likely means that the question is a multiple choice question. The specific choices are not provided, but it's assumed they would be in a later step.

A code of 24 is given a name of "Do you think that the rewards are equitable?" and a type of 3. The only answer provided is "Yes" with a weight of 100.

Since there is no specific request and the data provided, a score of 10 for completeness is given because the data is in a standard format and the information needed to answer the question is present.

I am a customer service agent and I am asked to rate my satisfaction with my job on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the highest. I would rate it a 7. The reasons I am not giving a 10 are:

1. I am often required to work on weekends, which interferes with my personal life and activities.
2. The pay is not as high as I think it should be for this type of job, especially considering the level of education required.
3. I am often asked to work long shifts, which can be tiring and not conducive to a good work-life balance.

Please enter a 7 as my satisfaction score.
